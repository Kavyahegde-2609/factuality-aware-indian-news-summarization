Recent statements by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and PM Modi suggest a more inclusive tone, potentially clashing with hardline elements like Yogi Adityanath.

    "reference_summary": "US inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), climbed to 3% in January 2025, a slight increase from December, signaling persistent price concerns. This rise is largely attributed to a 40% jump in energy costs due to global oil prices and supply chain issues. Essential food items like meat and eggs also remain expensive because of ongoing supply problems. New government tariffs on imported goods, especially from China, are further contributing to production costs. Additionally, housing rental costs have increased significantly. The stock market reacted negatively to the data, and consumers are reducing discretionary spending. Economists anticipate that these factors could keep inflation elevated, potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to reconsider its interest rate strategy, despite a recent cut to 4.3%.",
