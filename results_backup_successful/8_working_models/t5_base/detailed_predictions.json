He refused to endorse policies he believed would harm Austria\u2019s economic competitiveness.  \n\nSocial Democratic leader Andreas Babler called the breakdown a missed chance to address Austria's challenges, including a 3.7% budget deficit exceeding EU limits.

Their strong response against the BJP's \"400 paar\" narrative highlights their growing political awareness and importance in upcoming campaigns by both BJP and Congress.\n\nThird, the BJP-RSS relationship is under scrutiny as the RSS approaches its centenary. While the Sangh prefers collective leadership over personality-driven politics, it\u2019s unlikely to directly challenge Modi. Recent statements by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and PM Modi suggest a more inclusive tone, potentially clashing with hardline elements like Yogi Adityanath. Fourth, regional parties could reshape the political landscape, depending on leaders like Kejriwal, Nitish Kumar, and Mamata Banerjee. AAP\u2019s success may elevate Kejriwal\u2019s national standing and impact the INDIA bloc\u2019s leadership dynamics. Lastly, Priyanka Gandhi\u2019s rise is being closely watched following her parliamentary debut.

Essential food items like meat and eggs also remain expensive because of ongoing supply problems. New government tariffs on imported goods, especially from China, are further contributing to production costs. Additionally, housing rental costs have increased significantly.
