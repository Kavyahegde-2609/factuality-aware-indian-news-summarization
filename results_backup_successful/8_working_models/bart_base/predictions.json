It also makes up for the lack of nutrients in the stomach and intestines, which can be harmful to digestion and some vitamins from the leftover food material. The Colon houses billions of bacteria, collectively known as the gut microbiome, which aid digestion, produce certain vitamins, and protect against harmful pathogens. A healthy colon ensures smooth digestion and overall well-being.How to Eat Festive FoodFestive eating often involves low-fiber, high-fat, and heavily processed foods, which in turn can harm your colon in several ways. Processed and fatty foods slow down digestion, increasing the time food stays in the colon. This can lead to decay, fermentation, and toxin buildup. Over time, these issues can compromise colon health",
