    "reference_summary": "A study highlighting the accessibility issues in stroke care in India has revealed that ischaemic stroke patients often have to travel more than 100 km to reach the nearest treatment centers for intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular therapy (EVT). Ischaemic stroke, the most common type, accounts for 70-80% of all strokes in India. The study found that only about a quarter of the Indian population has access to rehabilitation centers within an hour of suffering a stroke. With fewer than one stroke center per million people, the research suggests that urgent efforts are needed to establish more treatment centers in underserved regions. The findings emphasize the importance of improving access to these critical treatments to improve outcomes for stroke patients. Currently, about 26% of the population can reach an IVT center within an hour, while only 20% have access to an EVT center.",

The incident occurred on Day 2, just before stumps, when Bumrah was trying to speed up the game. Usman Khawaja, batting at the time, attempted to disrupt Bumrah\u2019s rhythm by stopping him in his run-up. Bumrah reacted by gesturing for Khawaja to get ready, which led to Konstas, standing at the non-striker\u2019s end, throwing words at Bumrah. The two exchanged tense remarks before the umpire intervened. Australia won the Test and the series 3-1, ending a 10-year wait for the BGT.",

This disagreement has led to accusations that Governor Ravi is politicizing the event and avoiding his constitutional duty to present the government's policy statement1.\n\nIn previous years, Governor Ravi has also skipped portions of the address prepared by the State government, including references to the 'Dravidian model of governance' and praise for the law and order situation in the State.

Essential food items like meat and eggs also remain expensive because of ongoing supply problems. New government tariffs on imported goods, especially from China, are further contributing to production costs. Additionally, housing rental costs have increased significantly.
