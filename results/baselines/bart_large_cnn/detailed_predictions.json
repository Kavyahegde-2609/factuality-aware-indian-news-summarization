This increase is primarily driven by surging energy costs, particularly gas and fuel, which accounted for 40% of the monthly rise. Essential food items like meat and eggs remain expensive due to supply issues such as adverse weather. New government tariffs on imported goods, especially from China, are also contributing by raising production costs.\n\nThe housing sector continues to see pressure with rental costs up 5.2% year-over-year. Although the Federal Reserve recently lowered its benchmark interest rate, inflation remains above its 2% target, potentially delaying further cuts. The stock market reacted negatively, with major indices dropping, and consumers are reducing discretionary spending. Economists anticipate inflation could remain elevated, possibly prompting the Fed to reconsider its interest rate strategy to stabilize the economy.",

Essential food items like meat and eggs also remain expensive because of ongoing supply problems. New government tariffs on imported goods, especially from China, are further contributing to production costs. Additionally, housing rental costs have increased significantly.
