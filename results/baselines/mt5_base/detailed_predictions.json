    "reference_summary": "The controversy surrounding Governor R.N. Ravi's address to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has indeed become a recurring issue. For the third consecutive year, Governor Ravi has sparked controversy by leaving the Assembly without delivering his address, citing the absence of the national anthem before his speech as an insult to the Constitution and the national anthem2.\n\nThe State government maintains that the practice in the Assembly is to play the State\u2019s invocation to Tamil before the address and the national anthem at the end of the Governor\u2019s speech, a practice that was communicated to the Governor's office. This disagreement has led to accusations that Governor Ravi is politicizing the event and avoiding his constitutional duty to present the government's policy statement1.\n\nIn previous years, Governor Ravi has also skipped portions of the address prepared by the State government, including references to the 'Dravidian model of governance' and praise for the law and order situation in the State. Last year, he cited \"misleading claims and facts\" as his reason for not reading out the address2.\n\nThis ongoing conflict highlights the tension between the Governor and the State government, raising questions about the role and responsibilities of the Governor in the legislative process2\n",
