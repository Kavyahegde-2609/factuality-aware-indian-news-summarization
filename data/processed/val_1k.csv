The Hindu,2024-09-01 00:00:00,Sri Lanka’s main Tamil party to back Sajith Premadasa in polls ,"The Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK), a prominent political party representing Tamils of Sri Lanka’s north and east, on Sunday (September 1) pledged support for presidential aspirant Sajith Premadasa in the September 21 election.

The move, which reflects one significant position within the island nation’s fragmented Tamil polity, comes even as the ITAK’s former coalition partners — along with other political groups — back former parliamentarian and ITAK member P. Ariyanethiran as a “common Tamil candidate” in the presidential race, in which incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Mr. Premadasa, and opposition politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake have emerged as key contenders.

The central committee of ITAK met on Sunday and decided the party will not back Mr. Ariyanethiran, instead announcing its support for Mr. Premadasa, who Tamils voted for in large numbers in the 2019 presidential election, principally to reject Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Further, ITAK sources said the party would request Mr. Ariyanethiran to withdraw from the race, to arrest the apparent divisions within the Tamil electorate.

The ITAK was the chief constituent of the former Tamil National Alliance (TNA), a formidable grouping representing Tamils of the north and east in parliament. The TNA collapsed in recent years amid differences among members. The ITAK, too, is grappling with internal differences that have only aggravated after senior party member and noted Tamil leader R. Sampanthan passed away in July.

The ITAK’s position on the presidential polls was awaited by many, especially in the wake of party member and legislator S. Shritharan recently endorsing the “common candidate”. His party and parliamentary colleague M.A. Sumanthiran, meanwhile, has termed the idea of fielding a Tamil candidate a “nonsensical one”, arguing that the move would weaken Tamils’ bargaining power with the winning candidate, who will invariably be a contestant from the island’s southern, Sinhala-Buddhist majority.

Tamil voters are faced with different positions of their political leadership, ranging from backing a Tamil candidate, or a preferred Sinhalese leader, or boycotting the elections, as the All Ceylon Tamil Congress has decided to, protesting the many failed promises of past leaders.  

Following the ITAK’s announcement, Mr. Premadasa said on social media platform X: “Together, we’ll create a future where everyone wins — a future with no racism, no discrimination and a future built on unity, strength, and shared purpose.”

Mr. Premadasa, who released his manifesto last week, has pledged a new constitution where Sri Lanka’s current political system would be converted to a parliamentary system “with maximum devolution based on the 13th Amendment under one country”. The contentious 13th Amendment, which assures a measure of power devolution to Sri Lanka’s nine provinces, was passed in 1987 following the Indo-Lanka Accord. It is yet to see full implementation in nearly four decades. Successive Sri Lankan leaders have refused to part especially with land and police powers although many Tamil leaders see the legislation as inadequate for meaningful power-sharing.","On September 1, 2024, the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Katchi (ITAK) endorsed Sajith Premadasa for the Sri Lankan presidential election on September 21. This decision comes amid a divided Tamil political landscape, with some factions supporting P. Ariyanethiran as a ""common Tamil candidate."" The ITAK's choice reflects its past support for Premadasa, who was favored by Tamils in the 2019 election. The party is also urging Ariyanethiran to withdraw to unify Tamil voters. Premadasa has promised to implement the 13th Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution, which aims to grant more power to the provinces, though it has not been fully enacted.",International News,101,501
Hindustan Times,2024-07-13 00:00:00,Being lone Indian judoka in Paris not a motivation. India need 7-8 athletes...': Tulika Maan ahead of Olympics 2024,"Little less than a month back, Tulika Maan was delighted to the news of securing a quota in the 2024 Paris Olympics for India in judo. The 25-year-old, who bagged the silver medal at the Commonwealth Games 2022 in Birmingham, got the continental quota in the women’s +78kg division after securing 1345 points (between June 22, 2022, and June 23, 2024) to finish 36th in the standing. It was a moment of bliss for the Delhi girl, who also admitted that she is likely to remain anxious as well until her first match on August 2, and rightly so, given that she would be the lone Indian judoka at the Olympics this summer. But for Tulika, isn't motivating at all. She would rather want more judokas representing India on the biggest stage, which would not only prove the popularity of the sport in the country, but also help the athletes function as a team.


In an exclusive interview with Hindustan Times, Tulika opened up on her preparation for Paris, her mother's role in the 25-year-old making it to her first Olympics, and her competitors in the +78kg category. She also talked about her association with Evocus, and how its product, Hydration I.V, played a significant role in her Olympics training. Here are excerpts...

Q) The Olympics is just around the corner. How are you feeling? How has the preparation been?
So, preparations are going well. We are going to Valencia, Spain, for three weeks. After the training, we will leave for Paris directly from there. On the 26th, I'll reach Paris, and there, we will have a special camp for the players. After that, we will have a match, and my fight will be on August 2.

Q) Less than a fortnight back, the confirmation came on your Olympic qualification. What was your reaction?
I was already aware of the Olympics selection because we have a special ranking list in Judo. We have different rankings, like world rankings and Olympic rankings. From that, I learned I will represent my nation at the Olympics now. I was excited, but there was also a burden that now the whole nation's eyes would be on me. So, there was excitement, fear, and anxiety; everything was there during that time, and I still have all of that because until the first fight happens, it is bound to stay.


Q) Given that the field will have some big names - China’s Su Xin and France’s Romane Dicko - how do you look at your medal chances?
I haven't faced Romane Dicko et. My main competitor is Su Xin from China. She's incredibly powerful, quick, and strong. She's a force to be reckoned with. Apart from her, there's a Japanese player, Akira Sone, who is already an Olympic Champion. So I'll have to focus on these two athletes a bit more.

Q) You will be the only Indian judoka in Paris, aiming for a maiden Olympic medal for the country. Will that work as an extra motivation or pressure?
For me or others? This isn't motivation. I mean, be it our Judokas or Judo coaches, we want at least 7 to 8 athletes to represent our country in Judo in the Olympics. On top of that, this is better because we have a whole team at the Olympics who can support each other. This was the case in CWG, wherein 5 or 6 of us went to the games, so even when a single athlete was down, we used to push each other, saying that there's always a next fight and there's this saying that a group or bunch is better than a single person. So, it makes a lot of difference when a single person and a team are going. It's not like a single person is wrong, but having a team with you is kind of very important. So when the whole team goes, everyone can motivate each other, which proves to be extremely important. There's no rivalry when you compete for the nation; there, you aren't representing a state, district, school or college; you're representing your country. So if our behaviour is like that in the Olympics, I don't think we're supposed to represent India in the Olympics.

Q) Your mother watched you compete live for the first time when you finished on the podium in CWG 2022. Will she be following the Paris Olympics this time?
She has never watched any of my matches to date. She has never watched my live matches. During the match of CWG 2022, she had already slept. After completing the competition, when I called her and said that I'd got a silver medal in the CWG 2022, she said that's fine, now let me sleep. I mean, she watches the fights, but she doesn't watch live matches.

Q) If you could briefly talk about her role in your career so far and your introduction to judo
My mother's role, I would say that, of all the support that I've got from my home, my mother has supported me the most. Without her, I don't think I would be in this position right now because, in 2019, it was like we had to spend our own money to play competitive tournaments. So there, I still remember, at least 14 to 15 lakhs were spent during the whole year, and everything was paid for by Mom. There were three of us there who were paying our money to play: me, Sushila didi and Vijay bhaiya, and there was also a player, Jasleen, who was sponsored by JSW. I remember we went to many competitions in Uzbekistan and Tokyo, all at our own expense. So during that time, if my mother hadn't supported me, I don't think I would've reached the stage I am in right now.


Q) You have performed on big stages in Judo, but the Olympics is a different ball game. Are there any mental exercises that you follow to calm yourself?
I used to do Yoga because our coach follows Yoga a lot. So he instilled in us the habit of doing yoga to calm ourselves. So whenever there's any kind of mental pressure, I do Yoga. My favourite is Shavasana.

Q) As an elite athlete, how important is hydration to your daily training regimen, and how has Evocus Hydration I.V. specifically supported you in maintaining optimal hydration levels?
I am an athlete, which means I am required to drink at least 6 to 7 litres of water a day, and Evocus helped me a lot. For instance, there is a lot of soreness in my body due to dehydration. So during that time, my body needs a lot of electrolytes and Evocus helps me a lot because it tastes so good plus it provides everything that my body needs at that moment.

Q) Can you describe a specific instance during your Olympic preparations where Evocus Hydration I.V. made a noticeable difference in your performance or recovery?
It makes a lot of difference in training. Not much used to happen earlier because I just drank water, but now I've started taking Evocus. It helps me recover well and speedily after training and matches.","Tulika Maan, a 25-year-old judoka from Delhi, has qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics in the women’s +78kg judo category through the continental quota after securing 1345 points. She will be the sole Indian judoka at the Games, which brings both excitement and pressure. Tulika emphasizes the importance of having a team at the Olympics for motivation and support, rather than competing alone. She credits her mother’s financial and emotional support as crucial to her journey, especially during early years when she had to fund her own international tournaments. Tulika is currently training in Spain and preparing for her first Olympic match on August 2. She highlights the significance of mental calmness through yoga and the role of hydration, particularly the product Evocus Hydration I.V., in maintaining her physical performance and recovery during rigorous training. Tulika recognizes tough competitors like China’s Su Xin and Olympic champion Akira Sone as key challenges at Paris 2024.",Sports,154,1198

While talking to reporters in Budgam where from he is seeking election to the J&K Assembly, Mr. Abdullah said, ""Nothing is impossible as it was not the decision of God but the people sitting in the Parliament"".

The former chief minister was reacting to Home Minister Amit Shah's statement given while addressing an election rally in J&K's eastern Kishtwar district on Monday that Article 370 which, he insisted, stirred terrorism and violence and encouraged separatist elements to grow, is now history and will never be a part of India's Constitution again. Mr. Shah reiterated it at a BJP poll rally in Jammu earlier during the day on Tuesday.

But Mr. Abdullah said, ""Three previous decisions taken by the Supreme Court have been changed by a three-judge bench and the verdict given by a five-judge bench in December last year also can be changed by the seven-judge bench in future.""

He added that the Home Minister should focus on the situation in Jammu where terrorism is on the rise.

Addressing a press conference here, the senior BJP leader said the last 10-year period will be written in golden letters in the history of the country and J&K, and urged people to vote his party to power to continue good governance.

Shah reached Jammu earlier in the day on a two-day visit to kickstart the BJP’s campaign for the assembly polls scheduled to be held in three phases September 18, 25 and October 1.

“I have gone through the National Conference agenda. I want to make it clear to the whole country that Article 370 has become history and will never make a comeback,” the Union home minister said in his speech before releasing the BJP manifesto.

He said Article 370 is not part of the Constitution anymore. “This Article has only given arms and stones in the hands of the youth and facilitated them to tread the path of terrorism,” Shah added.

“I want to tell Omar Abdullah that whatever the results, we will not allow you to touch the reservation granted to Gujjars, Bakerwals and Pahadis,” he said.

Shah added terrorism will be completely eradicated from Jammu and Kashmir. “A white paper will be issued to fix the responsibility of those involved in the emergence of terrorism in J&K,” he added.

Hindustan Times,2024-07-12 00:00:00,Emergency: Centre declares June 25 as 'Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas',"The BJP-led Central government on Friday declared that June 25 will be observed as the Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas to mark the imposition of the Emergency.
The Indira Gandhi-led Congress government imposed the Emergency on June 25, 1975, leading to the suspension of most of the civil rights for over two years.
""A proclamation of Emergency was made on 25th June 1975, following which there was a gross abuse of power by the Government of the day and the people of India were subjected to excesses and atrocities,"" the government's notification, shared by home minister Amit Shah, read.

Amit Shah said the decision made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is intended to honour the spirit of millions ""who struggled to revive democracy despite facing inexplicable persecution at the hands of an oppressive government"".

""The observance of 'Samvidhaan Hatya Diwas' will help keep the eternal flame of individual freedom and the defence of our democracy alive in every Indian, thus preventing dictatorial forces like the Congress from repeating those horrors,"" he wrote on X.

The minister also accused former PM Indira Gandhi of putting up a brazen display of a dictatorial mindset.

""On June 25, 1975, the then PM Indira Gandhi, in a brazen display of a dictatorial mindset, strangled the soul of our democracy by imposing the Emergency on the nation. Lakhs of people were thrown behind bars for no fault of their own, and the voice of the media was silenced,"" he added.

India's audacious plan has been backed by current IOC head Thomas Bach. The last time India hosted an international multi-sport extravaganza was the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.

PM lauds Paris Olympics performance

Modi also congratulated Indian athletes for their fine effort in the just-concluded Paris Olympics where the country managed six medals, including a silver and five bronze medals through athletics, shooting, hockey and wrestling.

""Today, we also have with us the youth who made the Indian flag fly high in the Olympics. On behalf of 140 crore countrymen, I congratulate all our athletes and players"" he said.

A report from Indian Express has now revealed a potential rift deepening between head coach Gautam Gambhir and the team management following the poor performances in the series. Gambhir, frustrated with the team's underwhelming performanxces, is said to have pushed for the inclusion of veteran batter Cheteshwar Pujara, only for the selectors to reject his suggestion. Pujara, who has been absent from the national setup since the 2023 World Test Championship final against Australia, has long been a cornerstone of India's batting in Test cricket. Despite struggling in the WTC final with scores of 14 and 27, his overall record in Australia – 993 runs in 11 Tests at an impressive average of 47.28—has been formidable. Gambhir’s desire to bring him back into the fold highlights the growing concern over India’s fragile top-order. Even after India’s win in the first Test at Perth, Gambhir reportedly continued advocating for Pujara’s inclusion, knowing that the 36-year-old could bring the experience and stability the team desperately needs.

It was also reported that the Indian head coach delivered a ‘brutal assessment’ of India stars' performances following their disappointing defeat against Australia in the fourth Test in Melbourne. Another report from the Indian Express also mentioned that an unnamed senior player is ‘ready’ to take over as interim captain, believing the younger players aren't ready to undertake the leadership responsibility.
Pujara's role in India's wins Down Under
Pujara's past successes in Australia have been significant. He was the top scorer for India in the 2018-19 series with 521 runs, playing a pivotal role in their historic victory. His resilience at the crease—making bowlers toil for every wicket—has been praised by opposition players as well.

Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood, ahead of the 2024/25 Border Gavaskar series, acknowledged Pujara’s threat, stating, “I am happy that Cheteshwar Pujara is not here. He is someone who bats time and spends a lot of time at the crease and makes you earn his wicket every time.”","The Indian team's struggles in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy have led to increasing criticism, with reports revealing tension between head coach Gautam Gambhir and the team management.

The Bengaluru-based company has been receiving nearly 80,000 complaints every month, according to two individuals with direct knowledge of the situation, and its service centres are struggling to keep pace. On some days, the number spikes to 6,000-7,000 a day, causing long delays, leaving service staff overwhelmed and customers frustrated, they said.

The maker of the S1 series of electric scooters has sharpened its focus on its service operations by assembling a new team, drawing employees from the product and operations divisions, among others, according to the people cited above.

Mint has not received a response to queries emailed to Ola Electric on Monday.

Ola Electric’s problem of service delays coincides with a drop in sales. In August, it posted its worst monthly sales this year, selling 27,506 units—a 34% decline from July—and saw its market share drop to 31% from 39%. Competitors Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd remain steady in the electric two-wheeler market.

Ola Electric, which has sold over 6.8 lakh electric scooters since inception, operates 430 service stations across India, according to the company website.

Service woes at the centres

At least 10 customers of Ola Electric Mint spoke with said they have faced extreme difficulties in booking service slots despite being subscribers to Ola Care Plus, a paid service plan that allows users to book home pick-up and drop service appointments. Repair wait times are as high as 30-45 days for them. Many have taken to social media, particularly X, to voice their frustration.

“For two to three months, my scooter was lying at the service centre. I sent them countless emails, calls, and messages. The stand sensor wasn’t working, and it took me three months to get it fixed,"" Akhilesh Dabharde, 34, from Nagpur, told Mint. “Small issues keep coming up, but I can’t get them resolved. The battery went kaput once, the range dropped, and the rear wheel jammed. Every month or two, there’s a new problem.""

Ola Electric’s service centre in Nagpur is packed with scooters, Dabharde said, claiming as many as 1,000 are waiting to be fixed. “The product is not as sturdy as petrol scooters.""

Neeraj Gupta’s scooter has been parked at his Pitampura, New Delhi home for a month and a half. “It won’t start. The handle lock won’t open, and I can’t drive or tow it. Whenever I complain, no one comes. I always have to post on Twitter to get a response,"" he said.

He even filed a complaint with the National Consumer Forum, but the problem remains unresolved. Ola closed his complaint, which he registered in August, without resolution, he said.

Gupta said the staff at Ola’s service centre in Okhla, Delhi refused to take his scooter because it was “at capacity"" and unable to service any more issues.

A customer's breaking point

Nisha C. Shekhaar, a lecturer from Hos Kote in rural Bangalore, was so frustrated after battling with service issues for six months that she posted a photo of her vehicle on X, (formerly Twitter) with a placard that read, “Never buy an Ola scooter."" The post went viral.

Shekhaar filed a complaint in the Bangalore rural consumer forum in August, and her case was admitted on 5 September. Only after receiving a notice from the court did Ola finally act, she said.

“The quality is the real problem,"" Shekhaar said. “I’ve already had the screen changed twice, and I’m on my third one now. I’ve lost my peace of mind. I don’t trust the scooter anymore, and I’ve demanded a refund.""

Despite Ola’s efforts to overhaul its service response, the company has yet to fully address widespread dissatisfaction among its customers.

Earlier this month, a disgruntled Ola Electric customer torched a company dealership in Karnataka, citing his dissatisfaction with Ola Electric's service response to the issues his scooter was facing.

Understaffed, undercapacity

On New Delhi's Najafgarh Road, locals call an overcrowded Ola Electric service centre a “graveyard of scooters"". Close to 500-600 broken-down two-wheelers clog the basement and ground floor of the centre in Moti Nagar, which was formerly occupied by a Ford showroom. Inside, an employee said on the condition of anonymity, a team of four technicians struggles to keep up with repairs that require a staff of 10.

The center’s authorized service board has been taken down, leaving customers wondering when, or if, their vehicles will be fixed. The situation worsened after the company shuttered a nearby centre, and some customers have even approached the police after waiting more than six weeks for repairs, the employee said.

Mixed calls by analysts

Last week, brokerage firm HSBC flagged Ola Electric's recent market share loss as a “risk"" for the company and slashed its FY25-26 sales volume estimates by 15-20%. However, on Tuesday, the company's shares surged 10% to hit the upper circuit after Bank of America and Goldman Sachs initiated coverage on the stock. The brokerages project a 35-50% upside, betting on the company's market leadership and vertical integration efforts.

Citing that Ola is the largest electric two-wheeler company in India with a share of about 40%, Bank of America said in its 17 September report that electric two-wheeler adoption of about 6.5% in India is at “an important inflexion on EV curve"" as e-scooters are now priced below petrol scooters. “Despite being a new entrant, we believe Ola has sorted out key pieces of EV puzzle–proven and expanding product portfolio (not just a concept), reasonable funding access, brand and distribution reach, R&D/technology focus and large addressable market,"" it said."," Ola Electric has assembled a new service team as the maker of battery-powered scooters grapples with a mounting pile-up of service complaints from customers. The Bengaluru-based company has been receiving nearly 80,000 complaints every month, according to two individuals with direct knowledge of the situation. Company has sharpened its focus on its service operations by drawing employees from the product and operations divisions.",General,63,946
The Sentinel,2024-08-19 00:00:00,"Biden’s journey: After getting knocked down, he keeps getting back up.","CHICAGO | Sixteen years ago, a triumphant Joe Biden addressed an adoring crowd at the Democratic National Convention in Denver, his smile radiating confidence about the country’s future and his own journey.

The soon-to-be vice president hugged his son Beau. He spoke about how his own parents had endowed him with a sense of grit and tenacity.

“Champ, when you get knocked down, get up,” he recalled his father, Joe, saying. Biden then repeated the lesson taught to him by his mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, who was seated in the audience: “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.”

In 2024, Biden was not forced to reconcile a failure of his presidency. He compiled a list of significant accomplishments that will be felt for years. But he chose to give up his campaign under pressure from Democratic leaders, in a remarkable concession to the passage of time, when allies in his party and a clear majority of U.S. adults concluded the 81-year-old should not seek reelection. After Biden’s decision to leave the presidential race, his party not only forgave him, its leaders praised him.

So Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. comes to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week both revered and resigned.

Biden had consolidated his party’s support and did not have a serious competitor. But that support crumbled after a disastrous debate in June when his frailties were on unsparing public display, reinforcing his greatest liability — that at his age he might no longer be up for the job.

In Chicago, Biden has decided to get back up and show the difference between stepping aside and quitting. His vice president, Kamala Harris, is now in the spotlight as the nominee. For the president, it’s the latest in a life marked by the cycles of loss and recovery.

“He has had wonderful things happen to him and he has had terrible things happen to him,” said Ted Kaufman, his friend, former aide and appointed successor in the Senate from Delaware.

This story is based on interviews with aides, colleagues and those who have worked with Biden over a half-century career in politics.

Biden arrived at the White House with a hope that a focus on the public good could help heal the partisan malice that emerged with the ascent of former President Donald Trump, now again the Republican nominee.

No one denied the ego necessary to pursue the White House. But those interviewed stressed that Biden sees his legacy more as a leader who could demonstrate during a cynical era that government was a force for good.

“It’s less about him,” said Stefanie Feldman, an assistant to the president and the White House staff secretary. “He wants people to understand that the federal government is delivering results.”

Biden deployed his decades in the Senate to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. He signed into law far-reaching investments in advanced technologies and brokered a debt deal with Republicans to avoid a catastrophic default. Biden last week stressed that he was reducing prices on 10 of Medicare’s costliest prescription drugs.

He also helped to restore the faith of longtime allies that the United States could be an unflinching partner, and led the effort to provide much needed backing for Ukraine’s war against a Russian invasion and to counter China’s rise.

He dealt with a pandemic, inflation, immigration challenges, a broken supply chain and a troubled withdrawal from Afghanistan.

“The experience he brought to the job — there’s no question — gave him the ability to achieve things that no one thought he could achieve,” said Anita Dunn, who worked as a senior adviser. “It’s not just experience though. It’s relationships. It’s understanding how Congress works and how members of Congress can be brought along to get things done.”

But Americans consistently saw not the accrued wisdom, but the stiff-legged, shuffling steps and the verbal struggles.

Born too early to qualify as a Baby Boomer, the arc of Biden’s political career has been full of remarkable successes and staggering defeats. He was elected to the Senate from Delaware at 29, only to lose his wife and daughter in a car crash. He found a new partner in Jill and sought the presidency in the 1988 cycle, only to withdraw after reports of plagiarism. Then he dealt with serious health issues, surviving two brain aneurysms.

His 2008 presidential campaign was a washout, but he became President Barack Obama’s trusted No. 2. Then Beau died of brain cancer and his other son, Hunter, succumbed to drug addiction. Against long odds, Biden won the Democratic nomination in 2020 and then beat Trump, only to have his party want someone else to run against his predecessor this year.

Aides have recalled Biden being told years before that China’s economic growth would be a positive because it would lower prices for consumers, even if it meant that more manufacturing would move overseas. “If it helps the consumer and hurts the worker, we have a problem,” Biden told them at the time.

Biden was so focused on middle-class jobs that he found his presidency, ironically, defined by the public’s desire for lower prices. Inflation was a symptom of global disruptions caused by the pandemic and war, as well as government spending meant to stabilize the economy for workers that helped spur a historic burst of hiring.

The tough logic is that Biden anchored his presidency with an eye toward what America could be like a decade from now.

Even as he personally believed he could beat Trump, the potential defeat carried the risk that his tax breaks meant to shift the country away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy and electric vehicles could go away.

A loss would mean the possibility of deeper tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations. A Trump return to the White House could mean the unraveling of the alliances that Biden had rebuilt.

Even as Biden had come out of political retirement in 2020 because he saw Trump’s movement as a threat to democracy, the former president remained a defining presence in American politics. Trump had engendered a deep loyalty from many voters, who made their objections to Biden visible with protests he could see from the presidential limousine.

“It may be that this is the biggest piece of unfinished business of his administration,” Dunn said. “He has raised the issues so that they are a concern for voters, which is at the end of the day how democracies deal with them.”

Biden had told voters he needed a second term to “finish the job.” But the work of a president is never truly finished, a lesson that’s clear from some of the portraits of other presidents that Biden displayed in the Oval Office.

George Washington served two terms, leaving a country in its infancy that was full of potential and peril. Abraham Lincoln was assassinated before he could win the peace after the Civil War’s end. Franklin D. Roosevelt never lived to see victory declared in World War II.

Unlike Lyndon Johnson in 1968, Biden’s second-term hopes were not undone by an unpopular war and violence in American streets. Unlike Harry Truman in 1952, he was not felled by a primary challenge.

But in retirement, Biden just might have another burst of luck to watch the future that his four years as president helped to create.","Sixteen years after his triumphant 2008 address at the Democratic National Convention, Joe Biden comes to the 2024 convention in Chicago, revered but resigned. Despite significant accomplishments during his presidency, Biden faced growing pressure from Democratic leaders and the public to step aside due to concerns about his age. His decision to exit the race followed a disastrous debate that highlighted his frailties. Now, Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee. Biden’s presidency was marked by bipartisan achievements, global leadership, and challenges like inflation and the pandemic. In retirement, he may witness the long-term impact of his four years in office.",International News,100,1232

 Hindustan Times,2024-10-16 00:00:00,Fasting and women's health: Karwa Chauth fasting tips to avoid hormonal disruptions,"It is that time of the year when married Hindu women prepare themselves for a day-long fast on the festival of Karwa Chauth, which will be celebrated in India on October 20 this year. However, it is imperative to consult a health expert before fasting to proceed without any problems and do what is right for your body. Fasting has long been acknowledged for its numerous health benefits but it can also negatively impact one’s health.
In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dt Varsha Krishna Gade, Consultant- Dietitian and Nutritionist at Motherhood Hospitals in Pune, shared, “Unlike men, women may experience different hormonal responses because of fasting based on menstrual cycles and reproductive factors. Fasting can take a toll on one’s menses causing irregular periods, longer or shorter periods, or even no period, it can impact luteinizing hormone and ovulation, and it can trigger cortisol levels in the body. Hence, women need to be cautious while fasting during Karwa Chauth. It is imperative to follow these crucial tips given in the article below to stay healthy during fasting and avoid hormonal imbalance.”
She added, “Karwa Chauth is celebrated by women wherein they fast for their husbands. This festival signified a strong bond between the wife and husband. Navigating the challenges of Karwa Chauth fasting can be particularly sensitive for women, given the potential for hormonal disruptions. One potent strategy is to ensure proper hydration before the fast begins. It is imperative to drink enough water when one has her pre-dawn meal (Sargi). Doing so can help maintain your body's fluid balance throughout the day. In turn, you will be able to reduce stress and prevent fatigue.”","As Karwa Chauth approaches on October 20, married Hindu women prepare for a day-long fast.

The Hindu,2024-10-07 00:00:00,"Government doubles monthly nutrition support for tuberculosis patients to ₹1,000","The Union Health Ministry on Monday (October 7, 2024) doubled the monthly nutrition support under Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY) for tuberculosis (TB) patients under treatment from ₹500 to ₹1,000. Additionally, all household contacts of TB patients will be covered under the Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (PMTBMBA) and will be eligible to receive social support from the community.
Although elimination of tuberculosis is one of the sustainable development targets to be achieved by 2030 by the world, India has set the target of 2025. According to the Health Ministry, India has been engaged in TB control activities for more than 50 years, yet the disease continues to be the country’s severest health crisis. TB kills an estimated 4,80,000 Indians every year.
“In alignment with India’s commitment to accelerate the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to TB elimination, key initiatives aimed at enhancing nutrition support for TB patients and their household contacts have been brought in,’’ said the Ministry.
The Ministry has introduced Energy Dense Nutrition Supplementation (EDNS) for all patients with BMI<18.5 and has permitted the expansion of scope and coverage of Ni-kshay Mitra initiative under PMTBMBA to the family members (household contacts) of TB patients. Additionally, all TB patients will now receive nutritional support of ₹3,000 to ₹6,000 under NPY.

The enhancement of NPY support will benefit 25 lakh TB patients in a year, introduction of EDNS would cover approximately 12 lakh underweight patients (BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2 at the time of diagnosis). EDNS would be provided to all eligible patients for the first two months of their treatment
“This move will cost the Government of India approximately an additional ₹1,040 crore to be shared between the Centre and States on a 60:40 basis,” said Union Health Minister J.P. Nadda.
In addition to TB patients, Ni-kshay Mitras will adopt the household contacts of TB patients for distribution of food baskets with a view to improve the immunity of the family members of TB patients. This would lead to a significant reduction in out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients and their families.

“These measures are expected to aid nutritional recovery, improve response to treatment and outcomes and reduce mortality due to TB in India,” the Ministry noted.","On October 7, 2024, the Union Health Ministry announced an increase in monthly nutritional support under the Ni-kshay Poshan Yojana (NPY) for tuberculosis (TB) patients, raising the amount from ₹500 to ₹1,000. In addition, all household contacts of TB patients will now be covered under the Pradhan Mantri TB Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan (PMTBMBA) and can access social support.

India aims to eliminate tuberculosis by 2025, ahead of the global target of 2030. Despite decades of TB control efforts, the disease remains a severe health crisis in the country, causing an estimated 480,000 deaths annually. To address this, the Ministry has introduced Energy Dense Nutrition Supplementation (EDNS) for patients with a Body Mass Index (BMI) under 18.5 and expanded the Ni-kshay Mitra initiative to include family members of TB patients.

The NPY enhancement is expected to benefit 2.5 million TB patients and the introduction of EDNS aims to assist about 1.2 million underweight patients. The government estimates an additional cost of ₹1,040 crore for these initiatives. These measures are designed to improve nutritional recovery, treatment response, and reduce TB-related mortality in India.",National News,181,370

hindustan times,2024-11-12 00:00:00,"Trump picks Mike Waltz, China hawk, House India caucus co-chair, as NSA","Waltz is one of India’s strongest supporters on Capitol Hill, viewing Washington DC’s partnership with New Delhi largely through the prism of their shared rivalry with Beijing

Washington: President-elect Donald Trump has picked Michael Waltz, a House representative from Florida and a colonel in the US Army National Guard, as his national security advisor (NSA).
Among the most staunchly critical voices on China in the US Congress, Waltz is the co-chair of the House India caucus and has been strongly supportive of the US-India strategic partnership, even calling for a formal security alliance with India. He has highlighted the threat India faced from China, warned against the China-Pakistan axis as posing a threat to both the US and India, and underlined the economic convergences between the US and India.
Waltz, 50, also co-led a Congressional delegation to India last year and attended the Independence Day celebrations at Red Fort on August 15, 2023, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledging the presence of his delegation during his speech.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on Waltz’s nomination on Monday evening Eastern time, a story that was subsequently confirmed by other American media outlets.

Waltz has been a strong Trump supporter. At the Republican National Convention (RNC) in Milwaukee this July, slamming President Joe Biden’s national security record, Waltz said, “Under President Trump, we defeated ISIS, broke Iran, stood with Israel, always stood with our allies, made China pay. You didn’t see any spy balloons under President Trump, did you? He deterred Russia…He defused North Korea. He got hostages home.”
Waltz is the first Green Beret, a part of the US Army Special Forces, to serve in Congress. He served in combat in Afghanistan. Waltz’s wife, Julia Nesheiwat, was Trump’s homeland security advisor at the end of his first term.

Waltz played a key role in shaping Trump’s position on the Biden administration’s withdrawal from Afghanistan — many consider this a turning point in how the electorate viewed Biden’s national security record, for Biden’s approval ratings never recovered from that point in August 2021.

At RNC, Waltz had a prime speaking slot where he spoke extensively about introducing the families of those personnel killed during the withdrawal to Trump.

Waltz, who served as a policy director in the Pentagon under Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates, is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He is also a member of the House Task Force on China, a group that has advanced a set of recommendations in various domains to counter Beijing. Waltz has sponsored legislation that aims to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals and another that aims to protect American universities from Chinese espionage.

A piece that Waltz wrote, along with former House speaker and Republican elder Newt Gingrich, in March 2021 calling for the Winter Olympics to be moved out of China altogether, gives a glimpse into Waltz’s views on China.

On China’s role during COVID-19, Waltz noted, “The CCP lied about, covered up, and silenced doctors and journalists about the emergence of COVID-19. It was the CCP’s deceit, self-interest, and irresponsibility that caused the virus to be unleashed on the world.” On China’s human rights record, he wrote, “The [ruling] CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has imprisoned up to 1.8 million Uighurs and other religious and ethnic minorities in internment camps in Xinjiang…The extent of these atrocities is irrefutable, and America’s position on this devastating issue is clear. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo determined the CCP is committing genocide in Xinjiang – and the new secretary of state, Tony Blinken, agreed with this determination.”

Waltz slammed China for having “eliminated Hong Kong’s autonomy”, and for having worked to “stamp out religion in China and ‘Sinicize’ religious doctrine”. “Church leaders, nuns, and congregation members have been arrested. Crosses have been removed from churches while other churches have been destroyed. Religious displays have been replaced with portraits of Xi Jinping. Bible sales have been restricted, while censors have removed ‘Jesus’ and ‘Christ’ from religious publications.”

In May 2020, offering context for his university-focused legislation, Waltz, in another piece, wrote strongly against Chinese “mass infiltration and theft of American research” at US colleges and universities.

“The Chinese government is stealing this information for later use against us. Beyond taking our research and development, the Chinese government is also using our universities as sites to further its propaganda machine and subtly portray China’s rise as benign and peaceful. To do this, the Chinese Communist Party has strategically placed over 100 state-sponsored Confucius Institutes on college campuses,” Waltz wrote. “China must not be allowed to skip ahead and steal its way to the top on the backs of American taxpayers.”

A call for a formal alliance with India

Waltz is one of India’s strongest supporters on Capitol Hill, viewing Washington DC’s partnership with New Delhi largely through the prism of their shared rivalry with Beijing.

In an October 2021 piece in Foreign Policy magazine, co-authored by Nikki Haley, the former US ambassador to the UN and Trump’s subsequent rival in the presidential primaries, Waltz called for the US to formalise an alliance with India.

India has made it clear that is not seeking an alliance, but the value of the piece lies in illustrating how Waltz thinks of India.

Waltz argued then that the US should “prioritise relationships that strengthen our standing in the world” and said that “the place to start” was India. “It’s time to form an alliance. As a nuclear power with more than 1 million troops, a growing navy, a top-tier space programme, and a proven history of economic and military cooperation with the United States, India would make a strong ally. An alliance with India would allow both countries to maintain and expand their global strength. And together with Japan and Australia, it would enable the United States to form a real deterrent to potential terrorist threats in Afghanistan as well as counter China,” Waltz wrote two months after the US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Waltz (and Haley) wrote that a US-India alliance would also give America an edge over China and that like the US, India recognised that China was a rapidly growing threat. They offered details of the 2020 India-China border clashes in the piece and then argued, “A US-India alliance would give China pause before further expanding into Central and Southern Asia…An alliance would also recognise the region’s shifting geopolitical realities. China’s newly aggressive posture toward India is not by accident. It is part of a broader plan. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is emboldened after shoring up support from India’s longtime foe, Pakistan…China now has a regional client state willing to do the CCP’s bidding and help bolster its international standing,” Waltz co-wrote.

Building on this theme of a China-Pakistan axis, a key concern for Indian security planners, Waltz co-wrote, “Growing collusion between China and Pakistan poses serious security risks for both India and the United States…For India, a US alliance would be a bulwark against a two-fronted conflict on its borders. For the United States, an alliance would help blunt Pakistan’s influence—a state sponsor of terrorism now propped up by Chinese investments—in Afghanistan. We need a new partner to prevent the creation of a terrorist super state that can attack our country again.”

Waltz also said that such an alliance can help with secure supply chains and reduce dependence. “We can rely on India as a major source of pharmaceuticals, technology, and critical minerals, supplementing our own domestic manufacturing capabilities. We should also continue working toward a more comprehensive US-India trade deal.”

He noted the importance of enhancing cybersecurity cooperation between the two countries and claimed that a formal alliance will build on the work done by the Trump administration in deepening ties. “The benefits of a US-India alliance are many. It’s also the case that we share many values. By uniting the world’s strongest and largest democracies in a formal alliance, we can do a better job of defending freedom in an increasingly tyrannical world.”

Waltz claimed that America did things with India that it did with allies, yet the current diplomatic status with India was described as a strategic partnership. “An upgrade is urgently needed. Just as our alliances with NATO, Japan, and South Korea transformed US security in the 20th century, an alliance with India would help keep us safe in the 21st century. It’s time to make that happen.”

Waltz’s engagement with India has taken other forms, including as the co-chair of the House India Caucus along with Democratic lawmaker Ro Khanna.

In June 2023, at the time of Modi’s state visit to the US, Waltz tweeted, “The US and India are bonded by our shared national security interests and democratic values. It’s a no-brainer to streamline military sales to help both of our nations bolster security in the Indo-Pacific.”

He called the partnership the most consequential of the 21st century and said, “As the world’s largest democracy & ally in our global competition with China, India’s strength is essential to our national security.”

In August 2023, during his visit to Delhi, Waltz met Modi, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, and other top Indian officials, besides becoming a part of the first US Congressional delegation to attend the Independence Day celebrations.","President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Congressman Michael Waltz as his National Security Advisor. Waltz, a strong Trump supporter and the first Green Beret to serve in Congress, is known for his critical stance on China and staunch support for the US-India strategic partnership.

Hindustan Times ,2024-12-11 00:00:00,FIR registered against Sikh preacher Dhadrianwale in 2012 rape-murder case: DGP to Punjab and Haryana HC,"Punjab police chief on Tuesday told the high court that state police have booked Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale in a 2012 alleged case of rape and murder of a woman reported in Patiala.


The affidavit submitted by the DGP further says that two superintendents of police-level officers Sewa Singh Malhi (now retired) and Ashok Kumar, supervisory officers in the case back then, have been issued show-cause notices on December 7, the day the FIR was registered at the Passiana police station in Patiala.

As per police, Dhadrianwale, who heads Parmeshwar Dwar Gurdwara, a dera in Shekupura village of Patiala district, has been named as accused in the FIR registered under sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Dhadrianwale is said to have a large following in the state and Punjab diaspora overseas.

The information was given on a plea from the brother of the victim, a Patiala resident, who had claimed that the woman was poisoned in 2012.

His allegations are that his sister was raped and murdered, and police, due to pressure, did not investigate the matter.

As per the plea, in 2002 her sister became a follower of Dhadrianwale and used to go to his dera. He has alleged that she was raped by Dhadrianwale and murdered in 2012.



The petition was taken up on November 14 and during the hearing, the bench presided over by the chief justice Sheel Nagu had questioned how an FIR was not registered in a cognisable offence.

Initially, an affidavit was filed by the SSP but the court remained dissatisfied with the response and on November 29, it asked DGP’s to explain what action had been taken against officers, who approved the closure report in the case.

As per the DGP Gaurav Yadav’s affidavit, the woman was found unconscious on April 22, 2012, outside the gate of dera in Sheikhpura. She later died at the hospital, before she could make a statement.

A day after death, her mother recorded a statement and didn’t raise suspicion against any person for the death, the affidavit adds.

Later that year, police recorded statements of other family members, including her brothers, in which it was stated that she had consumed some poisonous substance on her own. No suicide note was left behind, the affidavit says, adding that in May 2012 her mother and other family members again testified that they do not suspect any foul play. The police forwarded the inquest report on June 28, 2013, which was approved by the sub-divisional magistrate, Patiala, on February 3, 2014, the DGP has stated.

The DGP’s report reveals that between June 19, 2012, and September 9, 2012, the sister of the deceased filed complaints before police seeking action against Dhadrianwale.

An enquiry was conducted by then station house officer, Passiana, and recommended the filing of the complaints. It was also approved by the senior superintendent of police, Patiala, on December 7, 2012, and complaints were filed, however, the case was not pursued.

Now, Malhi, who was then deputy superintendent of police, Samana, and Ashok Kumar, who was then station house officer, Passiana, have been issued show-cause notices.

The affidavit added that now, the police might struggle with the findings of the probe by local police as records till December 31, 2014, have been destroyed in October 2020 as per the standard practice.

As per the DGP, the petitioner’s brother complained on December 21, 2023, that he was threatened by some persons allegedly linked to Dhadrianwale for speaking against him. The DGP office also received the complaint, which was forwarded to SSP, Patiala on October 16, 2024.

Dhadrianwale refutes allegations

Patiala Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale refuted the allegations against him and claimed that he would come clean in the probe. In a video message, Dhadrianwale said he would cooperate with police in the investigation and would also appear before the police if asked.

“I am also shocked like my followers regarding the registration of FIR against me. I am ready for the investigation and will fully cooperate with the police. I am sure that I will come clean.”

Citing the post-mortem report, the preacher claimed that there was no mention of any rape or murder, and the case was closed back then.

He further claimed that the girl’s kin had back then denied any further investigation into the case.

“Now, they have moved Punjab and Haryana high court. Family members have a doubt that this (rape and murder) might have happened to their daughter. They should clear their doubt which is a good thing. It may take some time, but I am sure that I will come clean in this case,” the preacher added.

Punjab police have registered an FIR against Sikh preacher Ranjit Singh Dhadrianwale in connection with the alleged rape and murder of a woman in Patiala in 2012. The victim’s family accused Dhadrianwale of poisoning, raping, and killing the woman, who had been a follower of his dera since 2002. The case was initially closed after family members reportedly did not suspect foul play, but it was reopened following a petition alleging police negligence. Two police officers involved in the original investigation have been issued show-cause notices for their handling of the case. Dhadrianwale has denied all allegations, pledging full cooperation with the ongoing probe and claiming the post-mortem report did not indicate rape or murder. The case has resurfaced amid concerns of intimidation against the victim’s family. The police are now working to investigate despite the destruction of earlier case files, with hopes of bringing clarity to the matter.

Several political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, including PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, on July 13 claimed authorities have put them under house arrest to prevent them from visiting the 'martyrs' graveyard' to pay homage to the 22 Kashmiri people killed by the army of a Dogra ruler on this day in 1931.

However, there was no official word on the claims made by the politicians.

Ms. Mehbooba, a former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, alleged that she was put under ""house arrest"" at her residence in Khimber in the outskirts of the city.

""The gates of my house have been locked up yet again to prevent me from visiting Mazar e Shuhada - an enduring symbol of Kashmir's resistance and resilience against authoritarianism, oppression and injustice,"" she said in a post on X.

The PDP chief said the ""sacrifices of our martyrs is a testament that the spirit of Kashmiri's cannot be crushed"" and added that ""today even observing it in remembrance of the protesters martyred on this day has been criminalised"".

""On 5th August, 2019 J&K was dismembered, disempowered and stripped of everything that was sacrosanct for us. They intend to erase each one of our collective memories,"" she said referring to the abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of the erstwhile state of J-K into Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

""But such assaults will only strengthen our determination to continue the fight for our rights and dignity,"" she added.

Separatist-turned-mainstream politicians and People's Conference chairman Sajad Lone also claimed that he has been put under house arrest.

""For no reason informed of being under house arrest. I really fail to understand what the administration gets in stopping people from going to the martyrs graveyard,"" Lone said on X.

He said people have a right to choose their heroes and ""the martyrs are heroes for the people of Kashmir"".

""Why be in a denial and why on earth would a non-resident government need to meddle in it. Actually believing that a government will decide on what has been historically heroic and who are the historical heroes is an unambiguous sign of despotism,"" Lone said.

The gate of the residence of National Conference (NC)'s provincial president, Kashmir, Nasir Aslam Wani, was also locked by police.

""The gate has been locked and police personnel deployed to stop us from going to pay our respects at martyrs' graves. I don't understand why. We will always remember their sacrifices,"" Wani said.

The party's youth wing president Salman Sagar said the administration was also putting restrictions on their political activities.

Sagar posted pictures and videos of the locked gates of his residence and claimed he was put under house arrest.

Earlier in the day, police stopped leaders of the Apni Party from visiting the ""martyrs' graveyard"".

Members of the Apni Party, led by their president Altaf Bukhari, tried to march from the party's Sheikh Bagh office here to the graveyard, around 5 km in Naqshband, but were stopped by police.

Later, the leaders held ""fateh"" prayers on the road and paid tributes to the 22 Kashmiris.

NC vice president Omar Abdullah said from next year, Jammu and Kashmir would mark July 13 to pay homage to the 22 Kashmiri people.

Reacting to the developments and referring to the impending assembly polls in J-K, he said this year is the last one the Jammu and Kashmir administration would be able to do so.

""Another 13th July, Martyr's Day, another round of locked gates and police excesses to stop people from paying homage to those who sacrificed their lives to establish a just, fair and democratic regime in J-K,"" Abdullah said in a post on X.

""Everywhere else in the country these people would have been celebrated but in J-K the administration wants to ignore these sacrifices. This is the last year they will be able to do this. InshaAllah, next year we will mark 13th July with the solemnity and respect this day deserves,"" he said.

The Supreme Court has asked the Union government to conclude the process of the conduct of the Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30 this year.

NC MP Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi said stopping people from paying their respects was not only disrespect to the idea of democracy but also a huge and ""ugly shift"" from the values over which the nation was founded.

Mehdi said the police and administration which used pay homage ""to those brave hearts is now told to block the ways heading towards that graveyard and put locks on the doors of those who want to go and pay their respect to those heroes"".

July 13 used to be a public holiday in the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and a grand official function was held every year on this day where the chief minister or the governor would be the chief guest.

However, the administration dropped the day from the list of gazetted holidays in 2020, after the abrogation of Article 370.

Besides the official function, mainstream political leaders also used to visit the ""martyrs' graveyard"" to pay homage to the 22 Kashmiris who fell to the bullets of the Dogra army while protesting the rule of Maharaja Hari Singh.

However, no function was held this year, and officials said some restrictions on the assembly of people were in place in the Naqshbandh area of Nowhatta here to thwart any gatherings and to maintain law and order. ","On July 13th, several political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, including PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, claimed they were placed under house arrest by authorities to prevent them from visiting the 'martyrs' graveyard'. This site commemorates 22 Kashmiris killed in 1931 under the Dogra ruler's army, marking a significant day in Kashmir's history of resistance. Mehbooba Mufti criticized the lockdown of her residence, emphasizing that such actions aim to suppress Kashmiri voices and memories, especially amidst ongoing political restrictions since the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. Other leaders, like Sajad Lone of the People's Conference and Nasir Aslam Wani of the National Conference, similarly reported being confined to their homes, denouncing what they perceive as governmental interference with Kashmiri cultural and political expressions. Despite these challenges, leaders vowed to continue honoring Kashmir's martyrs and advocating for their rights amid the evolving political landscape.",Local News,143,922

The space agency said its station-keeping manoeuvre on Tuesday ensured its seamless transition into the second halo orbit.
The Aditya-L1 mission, which is an Indian solar observatory at Lagrangian point L1, was launched on September 2, 2023 and was inserted in its targeted halo orbit on January 6, 2024.
According to ISRO, Aditya-L1 spacecraft in the halo orbit takes 178 days to complete a revolution around the L1 point.
During its travel in the halo orbit, Aditya-L1 spacecraft will be subjected to various perturbing forces that will cause it to depart from the targeted orbit, the space agency said.
“Aditya-L1 underwent two station-keeping manoeuvres on February 22 and June 7, respectively, to maintain this orbit. Today’s third station-keeping manoeuvre has ensured that its travel continued in the second halo orbit path around L1,” ISRO said.
The agency explained that Aditya L1’s journey around Sun-Earth L1 Lagrangian point involves modeling of complex dynamics.
The understanding of various perturbing forces acting on the spacecraft helped in determining the trajectory accurately and planning precise orbit manoeuvres, it added.

In the video shared by BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit, Srinivasan, the owner of Annapoorna, is seen interacting with Sitharaman, standing up, folding hands in front of her.

Two videos were being shared by several Congress leaders and in one of them at an event on September 11, Annapoorna chain of restaurants owner Srinivasan is seen purportedly highlighting concerns over varying GST rates. In the second video, Srinivasan was seen purportedly apologising in person to the Finance Minister.

Gandhi said if this “arrogant government” would listen to the people they would understand that a simplified GST would solve the problems of lakhs of businesses. In a post on X, Gandhi said when the owner of a small business, like Annapoorna restaurant in Coimbatore, asks public servants for a simplified GST regime, his request is met with “arrogance and outright disrespect”.

“Yet, when a billionaire friend seeks to bend the rules, change the laws, or acquire national assets, Modi Ji rolls out the red carpet,” he alleged.

“Our small business owners have already endured the blows of demonetisation, an inaccessible banking system, tax extortion and a disastrous GST. The last thing they deserve is further humiliation,” Gandhi said. But when the fragile egos of those in power are hurt, it seems humiliation is exactly what they will deliver, the former Congress chief said.

He said MSMEs have been asking for relief for years. “If this arrogant government would listen to the people they would understand that a simplified GST with a single tax rate would solve the problems of lakhs of businesses,” Gandhi said.

The Arunachal Front,2024-09-09 00:00:00,"UN official says Sudan’s war has killed at least 20,000 people","More than 16 months of war in Sudan has killed more than 20,000 people, a senior United Nations official said Sunday, a grim figure amid a devastating conflict that has wrecked the northeastern African country.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, gave the tally at a news conference in Sudan’s Red Sea city of Port Sudan, which serves as the seat of the internationally recognized, military-backed government. He said the death toll could be much higher.

“Sudan is suffering through a perfect storm of crisis,” Tedros said as he wrapped up his two-day visit to Sudan. “The scale of the emergency is shocking, as is the insufficient action being taken to curtail the conflict.”

Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country.

The conflict has turned the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas into battlefields, wrecking civilian infrastructure and an already battered health care system. Without the basics, many hospitals and medical facilities have closed their doors.

The conflict has created the world’s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who have fled to neighboring countries as refugees.

The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.

On Friday, U.N.-backed human rights investigators urged the creation of an “independent and impartial force” to protect civilians, blaming both sides for war crimes including murder, mutilation and torture.

Devastating seasonal floods in recent weeks have compounded the misery. Dozens of people have been killed and critical infrastructure has been washed away in 12 of Sudan’s 18 provinces, according to local authorities.

A cholera outbreak is the latest calamity for the country. The disease has killed at least 165 and sickened about 4,200 others in recent weeks, the health ministry said in its latest update on Friday.

“We are calling on the world to wake up and help Sudan out of the nightmare it’s living through,” Tedros said, adding that an immediate cease-fire is urgently required.

“The best medicine is peace,” he added.","Over 16 months of war in Sudan have killed more than 20,000 people, though the actual toll may be higher, according to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Speaking from Port Sudan, Tedros described the crisis as a ""perfect storm"" of conflict, displacement, and disease. The war, which began in April 2023 between the Sudanese military and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), has devastated cities like Khartoum and collapsed the health system.

Sudan now faces the world’s largest displacement crisis, with over 13 million people uprooted, including 2.3 million refugees. The conflict has been marked by widespread atrocities, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, such as rape, torture, and ethnically motivated killings.

Seasonal floods have worsened the humanitarian situation, destroying infrastructure in 12 provinces. Meanwhile, a cholera outbreak has claimed at least 165 lives and infected over 4,200 people. On Friday, UN-backed investigators called for an independent civilian protection force.

Tedros urged the global community to act and called for an immediate cease-fire, stating, “The best medicine is peace.”

DNA,2024-07-25 00:00:00,Hospital gives big update on disability certificate to Trainee IAS Puja Khedkar,"Ms Khedkar faces an allegation of using fraudulent means, including allegedly manipulating the physical disability and Other Backward Classes (OBC) quotas to clear the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examination. The authenticity of various certificates submitted by her to the UPSC is being probed.
A civic hospital near Pune, which had issued a seven per cent locomotor disability certificate to IAS probationer Puja Khedkar, has found in its internal probe that the document was as per the rules and there was no wrongdoing in its issuance, a senior official said on Wednesday.


The Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) Hospital, run by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) near Pune city, had issued the certificate to Ms Khedkar in August 2022.

Ms Khedkar faces an allegation of using fraudulent means, including allegedly manipulating the physical disability and Other Backward Classes (OBC) quotas to clear the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examination. The authenticity of various certificates submitted by her to the UPSC is being probed.
She applied for disability certification about her left limb knee joint back in 2022. She visited the hospital for medical examinations and was assessed by multiple departments. The certificate, issued on August 24, 2022, stated that she had seven per cent disability in the knee, officials earlier said.

YCM's dean Dr Rajendra Wable had sought a report from the internal speciality orthopaedic and physiotherapy department of the hospital following a communication from the district collectorate that asked the civic-run facility to conduct an inquiry if there was any wrongdoing in the issuance of the disability certificate to Ms Khedkar. The district authorities also directed it to lodge a police complaint if any wrongdoing was found.It also ordered that penal action be taken if any racket was found involved in it.

Dr Wable said, ""Last week, we received this communication from the Pune collector office, following which we sought a report from the internal speciality orthopaedic and physiotherapy department of the hospital. As per the report submitted by it on Monday, the locomotor disability certificate of seven per cent was issued to Ms Khedkar as per the rules.""

""But the certificate would not be of any help in obtaining any facility either in education or jobs. That certificate is of no significance,"" he said.

As per the investigation, no one was found guilty of any wrongdoing, Dr Wable added.

Ms Khedkar had earlier submitted two certificates, provided by the Ahmednagar District Civil Hospital in 2018 and 2021 for visual impairment and mental illness respectively, to the UPSC under the Persons with Benchmark Disabilities (PwBD) category.

The 2023-batch IAS officer, who was a probationary assistant collector at the Pune district collectorate, was transferred to Washim from Pune earlier this month amid allegations that she misrepresented herself under the physical disabilities category.

During her stint in Pune, she allegedly misused power and privileges by demanding perks and facilities she was not entitled for. She is also accused of availing the OBC and non-creamy layer quota in the UPSC.

Following allegations against her, her probation period was put on hold and she was recalled to Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration in Uttarakhand's Mussoorie. Last week, UPSC took a series of actions, including registration of a police case, against Ms Khedkar for fraudulently availing attempts in the civil services examination by faking her identity.

The commission has also issued a show-cause notice for cancellation of her candidature of the civil services examination-2022 and debarment from future examinations and selections.

The Centre has directed the Pune police to apprise it of the marital status of Ms Khedkar's parents amid allegations that she fraudulently availed of the OBC non-creamy layer benefit in the UPSC exam by claiming that they were divorced.","The situation involving Puja Khedkar, a probationary IAS officer, has raised serious concerns regarding the authenticity of her disability and OBC certificates used for the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) examination. The recent findings from the Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial (YCM) Hospital have confirmed that the locomotor disability certificate issued to her was compliant with regulations. However, this certificate is deemed insignificant for obtaining benefits in education or employment, as stated by Dr. Rajendra Wable from the hospital.

The investigation into Khedkar's case continues, with allegations that she manipulated her disability and OBC status to gain an unfair advantage. She had previously submitted certificates for visual impairment and mental illness from Ahmednagar District Civil Hospital, which are also under scrutiny. 

Amidst these allegations, Khedkar has been transferred from Pune to Washim, and her probation period has been put on hold. The UPSC has taken several actions, including filing a police case and issuing a show-cause notice, potentially leading to the cancellation of her candidature and future debarment. 

The Centre has also asked Pune police to investigate claims regarding Khedkar's parents' marital status, as this might relate to her alleged misuse of the OBC non-creamy layer benefit.

The unfolding investigation highlights the importance of transparency and integrity in the examination process and the need for thorough verification of all documents and claims.",National News,220,619

This decision comes after discussions with the stakeholders involved. The general said Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina had stepped down to make way for this new dispensation and left Bangladesh. Hasina is believed to have arrived in Agartala, India. The Dhaka Tribune reported that no one from the Awami League, the political party of the former Prime Minister, was present at the meeting with the army and other political parties.


The general urged everyone to stop the violent protests and said they would also talk to President Mohammed Shahabuddin to figure out the next steps. He promised that the new government would make sure that those who died during the student protests against discrimination would receive justice. Professor Asif Nazrul, a well-known law professor at Dhaka University, has been asked to help convince the students to stop their protests.

Insiders say the Indian embassy in Dhaka helped Hasina escape to safety in India.  A military helicopter flew her to India around 2:30 pm on Monday. A close adviser of Hasina shared that she wanted to make a speech to the people of Bangladesh before leaving, but was not able to. The latest media reports quoted official sources as saying that Hasina had landed at the Hindon Air Force base in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad and is expected to leave almost immediately for London.

Lakhs of protesters from across the country headed to capital Dhaka on Monday (August 5)—and had, more or less, taken over possession of the Prime Minister’s residence—after a violent weekend that resulted in many deaths. In response to the chaos, the military imposed an indefinite curfew and the authorities shut down Internet access to try to control the situation. The protesters were calling for Hasina to resign and for justice for the people who were killed. Local media reports said that, since the violence started in July, almost 300 people had died.

In response to the unrest in Bangladesh, the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) has increased security along the India-Bangladesh border.","Bangladesh's top general, Waker-Uz-Zaman, announced plans for a temporary government inclusive of all political parties after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina reportedly stepped down and fled to India.

After completing chemotherapy, recovery is a gradual process – the body needs time to regain strength and repair after the impact of the treatment (Source: Getty Images/Thinkstock)
Following the news of her cancer diagnosis in March 2024, Catherine, Princess of Wales recently released a personal update about her treatment, expressing relief that her course of chemotherapy was now complete.
Millions of people across the world receive chemotherapy each year – and it’s likely to increase. A 2019 study estimates the number of patients needing chemotherapy will rise by 53% from 9.8 million in 2018 to 15 million in 2040.

So, how best to look after your body during and after the treatment? Along with surgery and radiation, chemotherapy is one of the most commonly used treatments for cancer. It aims to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing them or stopping them from dividing.

But chemotherapy does not differentiate between cancerous and healthy cells, so it’s associated with a variety of side-effects including fatigue, hair loss, mouth sores, nausea and vomiting, infections, memory and concentration problems – and emotional issues, from mood changes to anxiety and depression.

Chemotherapy can also have a long-term impact on the body. Late effects can include neuropathy (nerve damage), heart complications, and immune system suppression – all of which can occur months or even years after treatment.","The article provides a comprehensive overview of the recovery process after chemotherapy, highlighting the physical, emotional, and long-term challenges faced by cancer patients.

Indian Express,2024-12-26 00:00:00,Why Giriraj’s Bharat Ratna pitch for Nitish gives a leg-up to JD(U) ahead of Bihar polls,"Despite being the NDA allies, the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) in Bihar have not held back on taking aim at each other periodically. Which is why Union Minister Giriraj Singh’s statement that Bihar Chief Minister and JD(U) supremo Nitish Kumar be given the Bharat Ratna – the country’s highest civilian honour – has set off talks in the state’s political circles.

Singh, who has been a known critic of Nitish, told reporters in Begusarai Wednesday: “For the last 20 years, Bihar has seen a lot of developmental work. Those who have not seen the regime of (Rashtriya Janata Dal chief) Lalu Prasad should know how much work has been done (under Nitish). Nitish Kumar has taken Bihar to new heights. Even (BJD chief and ex- Odisha CM) Navin Patnaik has done great works. These two leaders should be suitably awarded. They should be given Bharat Ratna.”



His statement sprang a surprise as the BJP and the JD(U) were squaring off barely two months ago – and that too over an issue concerning Singh.

In October, Singh’s proposed “Hindu Swabhiman Yatra” — which was held in some Seemanchal areas with a significant Muslim population — was slammed by the JD(U) for being “divisive”.

“Nitish Kumar has worked for fencing temples with the same zeal that he has worked for fencing cemeteries. Our government stands for religious harmony,” JD(U) MLC Neeraj had then said.

The question is, what explains the change in Singh’s approach towards his party’s key ally?
BJP insiders said that Singh’s statement was a “reflection of how indispensable Nitish Kumar is to the BJP.” All top Bihar BJP leaders including deputy CM Samrat Choudhary and state BJP president Dilip Jaiswal have already said the NDA would contest the 2025 state Assembly polls under Nitish’s leadership.

Amidst this, sources said, Singh’s Bharat Ratna statement can be seen as an “understanding” on the BJP leader’s part that Nitish remains the “tallest NDA leader” in the state, who would be key to its campaign in the 2025 state polls.

A BJP leader said that they have no “option but to keep Kumar in good humour”. “Deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha said at a function on Wednesday that the dream of former PM Atal Behari Vajpayee would be fulfilled the day Bihar has a BJP CM. But he rolled back his statement in a matter of hours, saying Nitish was a favourite of Vajpayee,” he noted.

Addressing a BJP event held to mark Vajpayee’s birth anniversary, Sinha said the BJP’s mission in Bihar was still incomplete, adding that “the true tribute to Atal ji will be BJP’s own government (in Bihar). Only then, the restlessness in our hearts will be calmed”.

Hours later, Sinha posted a video on social media, which saw him sitting in front of Nitish’s picture. In the video, he described Nitish as “Atal ji’s favourite”. “Nitish was sent to establish good governance here. Immense work was done between 2005 and 2010 to rid Bihar of jungle raj. The NDA government under Nitish Kumar’s leadership has freed Bihar from the jungle raj of kidnappings, murders, loot and rapes… NDA’s government will be formed under the leadership of Nitish Kumar in the future,” he said.

On its part, the JD(U) sees Singh’s demand of Bharat Ratna for Nitish as a shot in the arm, given the history of acrimonious relations between the two leaders.

A JD(U) leader said it was almost like Singh was “bowing down to Nitish” now. “Nitish has a proven track record with the NDA. We are also an important NDA ally at the Centre. The BJP will not attempt to outshine us. A leader like Giriraj Singh demanding the highest civilian award for Nitish seals the debate on the latter’s credentials as the leader and the administrator,” he added.","Union Minister Giriraj Singh's unexpected statement proposing Bharat Ratna for Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has sparked discussions, especially given the recent tensions between the BJP and JD(U). Singh’s praise reflects the BJP's acknowledgment of Nitish as an indispensable leader for the 2025 state polls. JD(U) sees this as a positive shift, interpreting it as a sign of respect for Nitish's leadership and governance. The BJP's support for Nitish highlights the necessity of maintaining strong relations with the JD(U) in Bihar's political landscape.",Politics,82,634

South Africa collapsed to 116-8 against Pakistan as fast bowler Mohammad Abbas ran riot on Day 4 of the first Test with the tourists closing in on their first Test win in South Africa in 18 years on Sunday.
 Abbas grabbed 6-43 on his return to Test cricket after more than three years and South Africa still needed 32 runs at lunch to seal a place in next year's World Test Championship final.
 Tailenders Kagiso Rabada, unbeaten on 10, and Marco Jansen with 5 not out was fighting a grim battle for the home team against the relentless Abbas.
 Captain Temba Bavuma's controversial dismissal punctuated a South Africa collapse as it lost four wickets for just three runs with Abbas grabbing three off his six balls. Bavuma, who made 40, surprisingly didn't request a television review when replays suggested that Abbas' ball had brushed the batter's pocket and didn't make contact with the inside edge of the bat but the South African skipper walked back to the dressing room.
 Abbas bowled an unchanged marathon spell of 13 overs, but had to wait until Aiden Markram (37) and Bavuma saw off the testing first hour.
 Resuming at a wobbly 27-3, with still 121 runs needed for victory, Bavuma and Markram showed plenty of patience against Abbas' probing line and length before the fast bowler finally got the breakthrough after the first drinks break.
 Abbas was rewarded for his brilliant seam bowling when he beat the outside edge of Markram's bat and knocked back the off stump.
 Bavuma survived a couple of close chances when he successfully overturned an on-field lbw decision against him early in the day and Naseem Shah couldn't hold onto a sharp catch at fine leg as he overstepped the boundary cushion while grabbing the ball over his head.
 South Africa had controlled the game at 96-4 before Bavuma's dismissal saw Abbas finding the outside edges of David Bedingham (14) and Corbin Bosch's (0) bat off successive deliveries and in between Kyle Verreynne dragged Naseem Shah's delivery back onto his stumps to give Pakistan a chance for victory.

However, weather experts predict a resurgence in rain activity, likely intensified rainfall over Delhi starting from July 2.” The capital will be on an “orange” alert due to rain, according to the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) seven-day forecast.


The forecast predicts a cloudy sky for the next seven days, with moderate to heavy rains over the next two days and thunderstorms with gusty winds across the city.

The IMD had predicted moderate to heavy rainfall and the capital was on an “orange” alert on Monday. However, no rainfall was recorded.

The IMD also released an advisory for the rainfall, outlining the expected impact and suggested activities.

According to the IMD, moderate rain is defined as rainfall amounting to between 7.6 mm and 35.5 mm in a day and heavy rain is defined as rainfall amounting to between 64.5 mm and 124.4 mm in a day.


The Safdarjung Observatory recorded 228.1 mm of rainfall in the 24-hour period ending at 8:30 am on Friday, more than three times the June rainfall average of 74.1 mm and the highest for the month in 88 years — since 1936.

The IMD defines very heavy rain as rainfall amounting to between 124.5 mm and 244.4 mm in a day.

The torrential rain that brought Delhi to its knees last week was not a result of a cloudburst, the IMD clarified on Monday.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an ""orange"" alert for Delhi over the next two days, predicting moderate to heavy rain and thunderstorms. Despite Monday’s forecast, no rain was recorded. Temperatures remained below normal, with a high of 36.1°C. IMD and Skymet expect intensified rainfall starting July 2. The Safdarjung Observatory recently recorded 228.1 mm rain—Delhi’s highest June rainfall since 1936, though not due to a cloudburst.

The Hindu,2024-07-10 00:00:00,BMW crash case: Shiv Sena sacks key accused Mihir Shah’s father Rajesh Shah as party's deputy leader,"Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde, who heads the Shiv Sena, on July 10 sacked Rajesh Shah, whose son Mihir Shah was allegedly involved in the BMW hit-and-run, as the party's deputy leader.

A one-line notice by Shiv Sena secretary Sanjay More said Rajesh Shah has been relieved from the post of the party's deputy leader. Mr. Shah, however, continues to be a member of the Shiv Sena.

“A BMW car driven by Mihir Shah allegedly rammed into a two-wheeler in the Worli area of south-central Mumbai on July 7, resulting in the death of Kaveri Nakhwa (45), who was riding pillion, while her husband Pradeep survived with injuries,” police have said.According to them, Kaveri Nakhwa was dragged for around 1.5 km by the speeding car before Mihir pulled it over, swapped the seat with his driver, and fled in another vehicle. The driver allegedly ran over her while reversing the BMW. Mihir Shah was arrested on July 9.BMC razes illegal alterations in bar visited by main accused hours before accident
“The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is demolishing unauthorised alterations made at the city-based bar that was visited by the main accused in the BMW hit-and-run case hours before he allegedly took the wheel of the car involved in the crash that killed a woman,” officials said.

The establishment — Vice-Global Tapas Bar — against which the action was being taken, is located in Juhu suburb. “The BMW car driven by main accused Mihir Shah allegedly rammed into a two-wheeler from behind in Worli area of south-central Mumbai on Sunday morning, resulting in the death of Kaveri Nakhwa (45), who was riding pillion, while her husband Pradeep survived with injuries,” police have said.

A civic official said the BMC's K-West ward office team reached the Vice-Global Tapas Bar this morning and started demolishing some of the additional alterations made inside the establishment.

The civic body had conducted an inspection of the bar on Tuesday to check if any unauthorised additions and alterations were made there. “Detailed measurements were taken at the bar during the inspection, the official said. The bar was given a notice before the demolition process began,” he said.

Earlier, the State Excise Department sealed the bar. It was visited by Mihir Shah and his friends on Saturday night, hours before he allegedly took the wheel of the car involved in the crash.

“The bar manager had served hard liquor to Mihir, who is yet to complete 24 years of age, violating Maharashtra’s legal drinking age of 25,” an Excise Department official earlier said.

“The action to seal the bar was taken on the orders of the district Collector for violation of rules,” he added. Mihir Shah’s father, Rajesh Shah, is a leader of the ruling Shiv Sena.","The recent events surrounding the BMW hit-and-run case involving Mihir Shah have led to significant actions by authorities and the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra:

1. **Incident Details**:
   - Mihir Shah, allegedly driving a BMW, collided with a two-wheeler in Mumbai's Worli area on July 7. The accident resulted in the death of Kaveri Nakhwa, with her husband Pradeep surviving but sustaining injuries.
   - After the collision, Mihir Shah reportedly swapped seats with his driver and fled the scene, leaving Kaveri Nakhwa dragged for about 1.5 km and eventually run over by the reversing BMW.

2. **Legal Actions**:
   - Mihir Shah was arrested on July 9 in connection with the incident.
   - The BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) took action against Vice-Global Tapas Bar, where Mihir Shah and his friends had reportedly visited before the accident. Unauthorized alterations were demolished, and the bar was sealed for serving liquor to Mihir Shah, who was underage as per Maharashtra's legal drinking age.

3. **Political Ramifications**:
   - Rajesh Shah, father of Mihir Shah and a leader within the Shiv Sena, was sacked as the party's deputy leader by Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on July 10.
   - While relieved of his position as deputy leader, Rajesh Shah remains a member of the Shiv Sena.

These developments underscore the legal and political consequences arising from the tragic incident, highlighting actions taken by both law enforcement and the Shiv Sena leadership in response to the situation.",Crime and Justice,238,459

The Indian Express,2024-10-12 00:00:00,"IPO-bound Hyundai India to invest Rs 32,000 crore in 10 years","Hyundai Motor India Ltd, which will come out with India’s largest initial public offering (IPO) of Rs 27,870 crore ($ 3.3 billion) on October 15, has proposed to invest Rs 32,000 crore over the next ten years as part of its India growth strategy.
The automaker is planning to invest Rs 6,000 crore in a new plant in Pune which will increase its capacity from 0.824 million to 1.1 million, the company said on Wednesday, adding that the 30 per cent capacity addition will boost its domestic and export volumes. Hyundai will invest aggressively in new products, future technology and research and development capabilities of the India unit, according to Unsoo Kim, Managing Director, Hyundai Motor India.
Hyundai expects India to be a fast-growing market and plans to make it a global manufacturing hub, he said in Mumbai.
The Hyundai IPO will be the largest share offering in the history of the Indian capital market. The company has fixed the price band of the IPO in the range of Rs 1,865 to Rs 1,960 per equity share of the face value of Rs 10, valuing the company at around Rs 1.5-1.6 lakh crore.
The IPO will close on October 17. The allocation to anchor investors for the IPO is scheduled to take place on October 14.
Public sector LIC’s IPO of Rs 21,000 crore in 2022 was the largest IPO in India before the Hyundai offering. Prior to this, PayTM launched a Rs 18,300 crore mega IPO in 2021.
Hyundai, the second largest automaker in India after Maruti, will be the first auto firm to go public in two decades after Maruti Suzuki’s listing in 2003.
The IPO comprises an Offer for Sale of up to 14.21 crore equity shares of face value of Rs 10 each by the promoter selling shareholder. Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea will get the entire proceeds of Rs 27,870 crore ($ 3.3 billion).
The offer would constitute 17.50 per cent of the post-offer paid-up equity share capital of the company. “The promoter will be entitled to the entire proceeds of the offer after deducting its portion of the offer expenses and relevant taxes thereon. Our company will not receive any proceeds from the offer,” the offer document says.
According to the offer document, investors can apply for a minimum of one lot size or seven shares worth Rs 13,720 and in multiples after that. The company has set aside 50 per cent of the net issue for qualified institutional buyers or QIBs, 15 per cent for non-institutional investors (NIIs) and 35 per cent for retail individual investors.
According to the company, since 1998 and up to March 31, 2024, the company has cumulatively sold nearly 12 million passenger vehicles in India and through exports. It’s the third largest auto OEM in the world based on passenger vehicle sales in CY2023, according to a CRISIL report.
Hyundai has been India’s largest exporter of passenger vehicles from fiscal 2005 to the first 11 months of fiscal 2024, having exported the highest cumulative number of passenger vehicles for the same period, says the CRISIL report.
The company posted a total income of Rs 71,302 crore for the 12 months ended March 2024 and a profit of Rs 6,060 crore.

“Bringing examinations, especially entrance exams, to zero error is the responsibility of both the Government of India and the state governments. We will work as a team to build confidence in the children of our country,” the education minister stated.
While several irregularities, including alleged leaks, plagued NEET, the ministry cancelled UGC-NET due to concerns about the exam's integrity. The CBI is investigating both matters.
As a preventive measure, the committee abruptly cancelled two other exams, CSIR-UGC NET and NEET PG. 
The committee proposed a gradual transition to online tests, a hybrid model with digitally transmitted question papers, and a multi-stage NEET-UG format to lessen students’ stress and improve evaluation accuracy.
It also recommended streamlining subject options in CUET to emphasize general aptitude and core subjects and increasing permanent staffing at NTA to ensure consistent, secure exam processes.","Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan announced major entrance exam reforms starting January, urging state cooperation for zero-error tests.

the morung express,2024-08-21 00:00:00,Gauhati High Court quashes appointment of 935 Police Constables in Nagaland,"DIMAPUR, SEPTEMBER 20 (MExN): The Gauhati High Court, Kohima Bench, has quashed the appointments of 935 constables in the Nagaland Police, which were made between January 2018 and October 2019, citing procedural irregularities.

Justice Devashis Baruah, who delivered the verdict on Friday, ordered the Government of Nagaland to conduct a new recruitment process. He directed the government to take steps for holding fresh selection by issuing advertisement in local newspapers which are well circulated in the state of Nagaland. The court emphasized that this recruitment should be held in accordance of law and the process is completed preferably within six months from the date of the judgment. 

The court ruling also granted a relaxation in the upper age limit for both the petitioners and the quashed appointees for the new recruitment process, while maintaining strict adherence to basic qualifications and physical examination criteria. The court also allowed the quashed appointees to remain in service for six months or until new appointments are made, whichever occurs first.
Friday’s ruling stems from 11 Writ Petition filed in 2022 by 26 unemployed youths before the court seeking the quashing of 935 appointments made in the Police department during the period January 2018-October 2020.

The petitioners challenged what they described as 'backdoor appointments' made without public advertisements, arguing that the selections were arbitrary and violated Articles 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Z Zhimomi, representing the petitioners, argued that the selection process lacked transparency, as there were no publicly announced criteria. The recruitment process had previously faced scrutiny during 2020, when protests erupted, led by the Naga Tribal Union Chümoukedima Town (NTUCT). The NTUCT claimed that only 208 of the 1,200 selected candidates were appointed through an open process, and it demanded that the state government provide evidence of transparency in recruitment.

The NTUCT had also prevented the training of the fresh police recruits at the Police Training School (PTS) and Nagaland Armed Police Training Centre (NAPTC) Chümoukedima.

During discussions in the Nagaland Legislative Assembly in 2020, opposition leaders including NPF member Kuzholuzo (Azo) Neinu had questioned the government about the recruitment process. 

Deputy Chief Minister Y Patton, who oversees the Home portfolio, clarified that public advertisements are not required for police personnel recruitment, except for the newly created Indian Reserve Battalion (IRB) posts, according to a Personnel & Administrative Reforms (P&AR) notification.","The Gauhati High Court (Kohima Bench) has quashed the appointments of 935 Nagaland Police constables made between January 2018 and October 2019 due to procedural irregularities and lack of public advertisements. The court ordered a fresh, transparent recruitment process within six months, with age relaxation for affected candidates and petitioners. The judgment followed 11 writ petitions filed by 26 unemployed youths alleging backdoor appointments violating Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. The recruitment had previously sparked protests and legislative scrutiny. The court permitted current appointees to serve temporarily until new appointments are completed.",Governance ,94,390

The Navhind Times,2024-08-02 00:00:00,Social cost of Goa’s rising excise revenue,"“Cheers to progress!,” “Soro jivak boro!” some MLAs proclaimed with gleeful satisfaction during the ongoing assembly discussions. Imagine lawmakers raising a toast to Goa’s economic prosperity, while the shadow of alcohol-related accidents and health issues looms ominously in the background. An MLA  suggested a complete ban and control on alcohol. Another legislator  passionately advocated for positioning Goa’s cashew feni alongside Scotch, Tequila, and Sake, emphasising its potential in duty-free shops. The meme-worthy scene of our leaders celebrating increased revenue, juxtaposed with the grim reality of a 300% rise in alcohol-related accidents and an alarming surge in drunken driving incidents, captures the irony perfectly.

Amidst the applause for economic growth, it is crucial to highlight the staggering increase in alcohol-related accidents. The first five months of 2024 alone have seen a 300% rise in such incidents compared to the same period last year. This surge includes troubling reports of alcohol abuse among the Goa police and state-run Kadamba Transport Corporation drivers being found drunk on duty. The booking of 237 motorists for drunken driving in Margao until May further underscores the urgency of addressing this issue.

Despite these alarming statistics, the focus in the assembly has often been on the financial benefits. Some MLAs argue that liquor is beneficial for health, echoing the age-old adage “Soro jivak boro.” However, this narrative ignores the devastating social cost of alcohol abuse, including the rise in binge drinking, substance use among children and young people, and the absence of adequate de-addiction and awareness programmes. Where is the control? Where is the vigilance?

In the midst of these discussions, one MLA suggested a complete ban on alcohol – a suggestion that did not evoke a serious consideration. This reaction underscores the deep-rooted cultural acceptance of alcohol in Goa, making any talk of a ban seem almost absurd to MLAs.

The Pioneer,2024-12-17 00:00:00,"It’s not just about chess, there’s lot of emotional pressure too: Gukesh on world title","His history-scripting world title was not just a result of good strategy on the chess board, said Indian Grandmaster D Gukesh on Monday, crediting mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton for helping him tame the “emotional pressure” of competing at the biggest stage.

The 18-year-old Gukesh, who defeated China’s Ding Liren to become the youngest ever owner of the world title, arrived here on Monday to a rousing welcome from enthusiastic fans and officials.

“In a world championship, it’s not only about chess. There is a lot of mental and emotional pressure to deal with. Paddy’s teachings helped me in that regard,” Gukesh said in a press meet organised by Velammal Vidyalaya, his childhood school.

Upton, a renowned mental conditioning coach, worked with Gukesh in the run-up to and during the the 14-game marathon event in Singapore.

“The suggestions and the conversations I have had with him, have been very important for me and my development as a player,” he said.

Gukesh also detailed how his association started with the South African, who has the experience of working with the 2011 cricket World Cup-winning Indian cricket team and the national men’s hockey team that bagged a bronze at the Paris Olympics.

“Paddy has been a very important part of my team. After I won the Candidates (April), I asked Sandeep sir (Sandeep Singhal of Westbridge Capital) for a mental trainer,” Gukesh recalled.

“He immediately put me in touch with Paddy Upton, who has a lot of experience working with high-performance athletes,” said the youngster.

In an interview to PTI a day after Gukesh’s win, Upton had lauded the teenager’s ‘self-awareness.”

“I think that’s the thing that’s really stood out, his ability to recognise his thoughts and manage his mind and his understanding of how to do so,” Upton said.

“...He is a world champion because he was able to manage himself and remain focused and stay in the game even though he’s 0-1 down right from the beginning. So that really is a mark of a champion,” he had stated.

Gukesh also thanked Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin and Deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin for supporting him in his chess journey.

“Definitely, there was a lot of support from the Tamil Nadu government. Honorable Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister invite me home and encourage me whenever I achieve something.

“The Tamil Nadu government sponsored me during the Chennai Grandmasters last year. They made all the arrangements. That’s how I won the tournament and qualified for the Candidates.

“If we get more support like this, I believe more chess players will come. I am very thankful to the Tamil Nadu government,” he said.

Gukesh is only the second Indian after the great Viswanathan Anand to claim the world title. Anand played a pivotal role in shaping the teenager at his academy here.

Accidental chess player

Gukesh’s father Dr Rajnikanth, who is an ENT surgeon by profession, said he encouraged his son to join chess sessions in the school as a hobby.

“You have to have interest and hard work, otherwise nothing will happen. We did not plan to make him a chess player, but enrolled him in Velammal school chess class as part of the extra-curricular activity.

“But we supported him once he showed interest and worked hard. As a parent, we tried to give him as much exposure as possible. That’s what I can suggest to other parents as well.

“We should try to give as much exposure as possible to what your children are interested in,” he added.

Rajnikanth said Gukesh likes to continuously play in tournaments to ensure that he always remains in touch with the sport.

“Some players play tournaments once in two months — one month preparation and next month playing in tournaments. As far as he (Gukesh) is concerned, games are his practice.

“He learns from his losses and wins. If I don’t give him a tournament for a month, he becomes restless.

That’s his choice,” he added.","Indian Grandmaster D Gukesh, who recently made history by becoming the youngest world chess champion, credited his mental conditioning coach Paddy Upton for helping him handle the intense emotional pressure of competing at the highest level. The 18-year-old defeated China’s Ding Liren in a grueling 14-game match in Singapore, with Upton’s guidance playing a key role in his ability to stay focused and manage his mindset, especially after falling behind early in the series.

Gukesh’s journey began somewhat accidentally, encouraged by his father, an ENT surgeon, who enrolled him in school chess classes as a hobby. Once Gukesh showed dedication, his family supported his passion, giving him ample opportunities to compete regularly, which he sees as essential practice.

The young champion also expressed gratitude to Tamil Nadu’s Chief Minister MK Stalin and Deputy CM Udhayanidhi Stalin for their ongoing support. Gukesh follows in the footsteps of Indian legend Viswanathan Anand, who played a significant role in mentoring him at his academy. With strong mental preparation and constant competitive play, Gukesh’s star continues to rise.",Sports,174,663

After his statement in 2014, Emraan received massive backlash, and in an interview, he revealed that he had to bear the consequences for quite some time. Now, in a new interview, Emraan has reacted to his incendiary comment about Aishwarya from a decade ago, and said, “I would love to apologise if she felt offended.”

In an interview with The Lallantop, Emraan Hashmi was asked if he regrets calling Aishwarya “plastic,” to which the actor quickly replied, “I regret it. I keep saying that I have utmost respect for everyone I spoke about.” Explaining further, the actor said, “I regret it because it was distasteful. Lately, people have become very sensitive. People get mad at everything on social media. In terms of the show, we were playing a game, it was all in jest. It was supposed to be taken sportingly. There are many such games in the show. Earlier, people weren’t this sensitive.”

He said, “Recently, Karan Johar himself confessed that the rapid fire round in the latest season of the show was the most boring. It’s because now, the environment has completely changed. You can’t give such answers anymore. At that time, I just wanted to win the hamper and I ended up saying what I said.”

Although Aishwarya never directly reacted to the comment. In an interview with Filmfare in 2019, the actor said the worst thing anyone has ever said about her is that she is “fake and plastic.”

When asked if he ever met Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Emraan Hashmi recalled an incident after the release of Hum Dil Chuke Sanam. He said, “I have waited outside Aishwarya Rai’s van for about three hours just to catch a glimpse of her after her film Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. I was a huge fan. Mohit and I were shooting in Filmistan, I told him, ‘You cannot go anywhere.’ So we waited together. I still am a big fan of hers.” Despite all the wait, Emraan could never meet her. “I have never met her. I have never had a conversation with her. I would love to meet her.

The Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) warhorse rocket Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) will place the two satellites - SDX01 and SDX02 - in a 476-km circular orbit and attempt the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDEx) in the first week of January, the space agency officials said.

""This mission will mark India's entry into the exclusive league of nations capable of mastering space docking,"" Union Science and Technology Minister Jitendra Singh said.

The SpaDEx mission is expected to be a stepping stone for India's future endeavours in space exploration which include getting rocks and soil from the moon on Earth, the proposed Bharatiya Antariksha Station and landing an astronaut on the lunar surface.

Only the US, Russia and China have mastered space docking technologies.

The secondary objective of the mission includes demonstration of the transfer of electric power between the docked spacecraft, which is essential for future applications such as in-space robotics; composite spacecraft control and payload operations after undocking.

""This capability is vital for India's lunar and interplanetary missions. Docking technology enables multi-launch missions and supports future human spaceflight,"" Singh said.

After the demonstration of docking and undocking experiments, the two satellites will continue to orbit the Earth for standalone missions for two years.

the hitavada,2024-07-17 00:00:00,Ratapani may soon get status of ‘Tiger Reserve’,"Track on lines of tiger reserve being planned Forest Department has planned to prepare track in Ratapani Sanctuary same like a tiger reserve. Decision has been taken after recording the rising population tourist in the area. The sanctuary has already safari facility for the visitors. In first phase, track will be prepared from Karmai to Barkheda and Ratapani dam while in second phase, track will be made from Pampapur gate to Ghodapachar dam. In third phase, track will be prepared near Jholiapur dam.
 
 
Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary is expected to get notified as Tiger Reserve soon as the State-level Wildlife Board meeting presided over by the Chief Minister Dr Mohan Yadav has approved the same. The proposal will be soon sent to the Center for final consent. National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) had already given in-principal approval to the project in the year 2011. Forest officials said that if all goes well, Ratapani would get notification of tiger reserve in next three months. The proposal was pending since year 2008 for various reasons. Subharanjan Sen, PCCF Wildlife MP, said, “Some formalities are still there to notify the sanctuary as tiger reserve.
 
This would help to connect the locals with employment opportunity. People across the globe will be visiting Ratapani to enjoy the wildlife beauty.” According to Census 2022, the sanctuary broke all records with 310 per cent growth in its tiger population. In four years, tiger count in sanctuary near State capital Bhopal has risen from 18 to 56. The sanctuary area has abundance of 65 to 72 stripped cats. According to Census 2022, Ratapani Landscape (150 km area range) has 96 tigers including 7 tigers in Bhopal and 7 tigers in Dewas. Sehore forest circle has 10 tigers. As per Census 2018, there were 40 stripped cats in the landscape. Though the Forest Department claimed for 22 tigers, including 13 adult and 9 cubs, around Bhopal but after census report, real data revealed as 7 tigers. Forest department had claimed for 88 tigers in the landscape but only 8 tigers were increased in this census. Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary is the only sanctuary in State having higher number of tigers after Bandhavgarh and Kanha Tiger Reserve. It is commonly known in Madhya Pradesh that insufficient space for the tigers and leopards is giving tough time to the wildlife as well as forest officials. Like Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, now Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary is also facing space crunch for the tigers.
 
Proposal to declare the wildlife sanctuary as ‘tiger reserve’ is pending for more than 15 years. Forest officials and wildlife experts have raised voice many times to make the sanctuary as tiger reserve for safe and secure habitat to the wildlife. Wildlife activists said, about 15 years back, in-principal approval to declare the sanctuary as Tiger Reserve was given by the Government. At the time, there were only 7 tigers in the sanctuary. The sanctuary is spread over 925 sqkm of area and around 60 tigers, 150 leopards and many other species are residing in the jungle.","Track on lines of tiger reserve being planned Forest Department has planned to prepare track in Ratapani Sanctuary same like a tiger reserve.

The Pioneer,2024-10-31 00:00:00,Reviving Bihar's libraries: Bridging the gap between tradition and technology,"A well-conceived hybrid model could revitalise Bihar’s libraries, providing a space where traditional and digital learning coexist

In today’s era of rapid digital transformation, libraries in Bihar and across India are facing a critical challenge: how to remain relevant in a world increasingly dominated by digital content and online resources.

Historically, libraries have been pillars of knowledge and learning, preserving history, culture, science, and philosophy for generations. However, with the rise of the internet, mobile technology, and social media, the traditional role of libraries is being questioned, especially in rural areas and smaller towns.The digital revolution has reshaped the way people, especially the youth, consume information. Where libraries were once the sole custodians of knowledge, the Internet now offers instant access to vast amounts of data. E-books, online courses, and educational videos are available at the click of a button, challenging the need for physical spaces to access information. While this shift has opened new avenues for learning, it has also contributed to the neglect and decline of public libraries, particularly in states like Bihar.Bihar’s once-thriving library culture has dramatically deteriorated. Where there were once 540 public libraries in the state during the 1950s, only 51 remain today, according to a 2022 report from the Bihar Assembly Library Committee.

Entire districts, including Arwal, Kaimur, Banka, Sheohar, Kishanganj, and Sheikhpura, now have no public libraries at all—neither in rural areas nor in urban centres. The closure of these institutions reflects a deeper cultural shift, where reading and communal learning spaces are no longer central to the lives of many. Muzaffarpur, highlights the concerning reality of the fading library tradition. Its few remaining libraries, such as the Gandhi Smriti Library and Nav Yuvak Samiti Trust Library, are either poorly resourced or neglected.

In a city of this size, there isn't a single well-functioning library that caters to literature lovers or cultural enthusiasts, leaving little hope for their counterparts in rural areas.Yet, as the world embraces digital transformation, the role of libraries must evolve rather than disappear. The challenge lies not in replacing libraries but in reimagining them as hybrid spaces—integrating digital resources with the physical charm and purpose of traditional libraries. Libraries, with their rich legacy of providing knowledge, can be transformed into community hubs that offer more than just books. They can become centres for digital literacy, e-learning, and skill development, especially in areas where access to the internet and technology is still a challenge.In this context, Vinay, a social worker from Muzaffarpur, suggests a forward-thinking solution: modernizing libraries to meet the needs of the current generation. Libraries should be equipped with computers, internet access, and resources for career counselling and education. ""We need to reconnect young people, who are lost in the virtual world, with the world of books,"" he explains.

Libraries can offer both—the serenity and richness of traditional books and the practicality and excitement of digital resources. This transformation would not only make libraries more accessible but also relevant to today's youth, who are accustomed to consuming knowledge digitally.

The success of such an initiative would depend on concerted efforts by local leaders, communities, and governments. For instance, establishing a digital library in every Panchayat would bridge the urban-rural divide, bringing digital literacy to the forefront while preserving the cultural and intellectual heritage libraries represent. Panchayat representatives and village intellectuals can play a critical role in promoting the use of these modernized libraries, ensuring that the younger generation has access to both digital and physical forms of knowledge.The ongoing digital revolution has created an urgent need to rethink the purpose and structure of libraries.

The Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Public Library in Patna, one of the few libraries still thriving in Bihar, is a testament to the potential of such institutions. However, unless libraries across the state are modernized to embrace digital tools and resources, their future seems uncertain.

The decline of libraries in Bihar isn’t just about the closure of physical spaces—it reflects the broader societal changes driven by technology. But rather than view this as the end of the library’s role, it should be seen as an opportunity to redefine its importance in a digital-first world.","Libraries in Bihar are facing a crisis, with the number of public libraries dwindling from 540 in the 1950s to just 51 today. Many districts now lack any public libraries, reflecting a broader societal shift toward digital consumption of knowledge. However, rather than letting libraries become obsolete, experts suggest modernizing them into hybrid spaces that integrate traditional books with digital resources such as e-learning tools, internet access, and career counseling. A well-implemented hybrid model could revitalize Bihar’s libraries, making them relevant for today’s youth while preserving their cultural and educational significance.",Education,91,689

But there was no guarantee if they could make citing India's stealth in the bowling department.

Opening the second innings for Australia, both Sam Konstas and Usman Khwaja were under tremendous pressure. Nineteen-year-old Konstas appeared he was in hurry and quickfired 22 runs off just 16 deliveries, but then India's Prasidh Krishna departed him when he carved into the off side.Following Konstas, both Marnus Labuschagne and Steven Smith went to pavilion as Kirshna did not allow them to settle. However, Khwaja kept his calm and made a partnership with Travis Head for sometime. But he again became a victim of Mohammed Siraj's pace and was dismissed after scoring 41 runs.Understanding the importance of the Test and World Test Championship 2025 qualification at stake, Head with debutant Beau Webster displayed remarkable patience and led Australia to win the fifth Test at Sydney by 6 wickets.Though the main prize was the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, however, this victory secured Australia their place in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at the Lords'.

Konstas was not that great with the bat, but his altercations somehow shifted India's focus a little.Next is Beau Webster, who made his debut at SCG in place of Mitchell Marsh. His first-innings 57 was one of just two half-centuries in the Test and unbeaten 39 in the second innings took away the game from India.

“I expect that it (resolution on the restoration of Article 370) would be the first business. If not the first business, I expect the resolution will be passed in the first session (of the assembly),” Mehdi, the Lok Sabha MP from Srinagar, said on X Space.

“That is what I have committed myself to and I have full faith that the National Conference is also committed to it,” he said.

Indian Express,2024-09-16 00:00:00,The heart-handshake connection: Your grip might reveal more than you think,"The good news is that grip strength is something you can actively improve (Source: Freepik)
A handshake is a simple gesture, often associated with first impressions and professional etiquette. But did you know that it may provide valuable insights into your cardiovascular well-being? 

According to nutritionist and content creator Deepsikha Jain, “When the grip of a handshake is strong it means that the heart can pump blood in higher volumes and proportions which talks about how good the heart health is.” She adds that a weak grip indicates poor heart health.

So, is this true?

Dr Jagadish J Hiremath, cardiac intensivist, says, “While grip strength isn’t a replacement for traditional assessments like blood pressure and cholesterol checks, it offers a quick, non-invasive, and inexpensive way to gauge overall health. Researchers have found that grip strength can be as predictive of cardiovascular health as some established risk factors.”

Physiological mechanisms linking grip strength to heart health
So, what’s the link between the muscles in your hand and your heart? Dr Hiremath explains them as follows:

Muscle Strength and Cardiovascular Fitness: Grip strength is a reflection of overall muscle strength and function. Studies suggest that people with stronger grips tend to have better cardiovascular fitness, including improved heart function and lower blood pressure. This could be because strong muscles require a robust cardiovascular system to deliver oxygen and nutrients efficiently.","The article discusses the correlation between grip strength and cardiovascular health. It explains that a strong handshake can indicate a healthy heart, while a weak grip may suggest poor heart health. Although grip strength is not a complete replacement for traditional health assessments, it offers a quick and easy way to gauge overall health. The article also explains the physiological mechanisms linking grip strength to heart health, highlighting the connection between muscle strength, cardiovascular fitness, and improved heart function.",Health and Wellness,79,228

The Hindu,2024-07-02 00:00:00,Reduce tariffs on manufacturing inputs for electronics: ICEA,"The Indian Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which represents domestic electronics manufacturers, called on Tuesday for a reduction of import duties as a key Union budget demand. “With a sustained increase in production with the help of supportive policies, including the PLI, India now has entered a phase when the growth of the mobile phone sector depends not on domestic demand but on demand in the global market,” the ICEA said in a report prepared for the Finance Ministry.

Pankaj Mohindroo, the ICEA’s President, argued against the relatively high tariffs India imposes on manufacturing inputs — China and Vietnam’s tariffs apply on fewer components and are of lower rates — saying that domestic component makers were increasing prices to just below the net prices of inputs to take advantage of the situation. “Global suppliers also consider the higher domestic price as their reference price in their negotiations with exporters because their imported inputs are duty-free for exports,” the ICEA report said.

These tariffs, Mr. Mohindroo said, were compounded by customs authorities hindering orderly shipments of key components, likening the situation to an imported shirt being held back on account of higher duties on buttons. 

Since much of the fresh production of phones in India is being exported, Mr. Mohindroo said, duties should be slashed to promote competitiveness of Indian assembly and manufacturing operations with the main other leaders in the sector, China and Vietnam. “Current high tariffs increase manufacturing costs in India by 7–7.5% on the bill of materials,” Mr. Mohindroo said. 

","The Indian Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA) has urged the government to reduce import duties to boost competitiveness in the global market. ICEA President Pankaj Mohindroo highlighted that high tariffs on manufacturing inputs increase costs and hinder exports. He compared India's situation unfavorably with China and Vietnam, which impose lower tariffs. Mohindroo stressed that lower duties would enhance India's mobile phone sector's competitiveness as it relies more on exports than domestic demand.",Business and Finance,72,252
DNA,2024-08-16 00:00:00,Donald Trump or Joe Biden: Which US President created more jobs?,"Ahead of the U.S. Presidential election, here's a comparison between the current candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump, and the current U.S. President Joe Biden, focusing on job creation, the unemployment rate, and wage growth. This report should help you understand the differences in their economic performances better.

According to a recent report by Forbes, the key aspects of the Donald Trump and Joe Biden's tenure have been highlighted.

Job Creation
During Joe Biden’s first 42 months in office, the U.S. added 15.8 million jobs, according to total nonfarm payrolls, the most commonly cited measure of employment covering most American workers. In contrast, Donald Trump’s presidency saw a contraction of 2.7 million jobs over his term. This difference is partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the labor market, which hit during Trump’s tenure and skewed the numbers negatively.
Unemployment Rate
Under Trump, the unemployment rate rose by 1.7 percentage points from 4.7% to 6.4%. During Biden’s presidency, the unemployment rate has declined by 2.1 percentage points to 4.3%. It's important to note that Trump’s early years in office saw a decrease in unemployment to a historic low of 3.5% before the pandemic hit, causing a temporary spike in unemployment.

Wage Growth
Wage growth has been slightly higher under Biden, with average hourly earnings increasing by 17% compared to a 15% increase during Trump’s presidency. However, Trump’s wage growth had a more substantial impact as it outpaced inflation more effectively. From January 2017 to January 2021, the consumer price index rose by 8%, whereas it increased by 19% from January 2021 to July 2024 under Biden. Americans saved an average of 8.7% of their monthly paychecks under Trump compared to 5.9% under Biden, indicating stronger spending power during Trump’s term.

Economic Context
Despite the challenges faced by both administrations, the U.S. economy has shown resilience. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), measuring the total value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., increased by 50% from 2015 to 2023. Both presidents have seen periods where the unemployment rate was lower than during Barack Obama’s presidency, except during the pandemic's peak.

This comparison provides a clearer picture of how each administration managed job creation, unemployment, and wage growth, offering insights into their economic policies' effectiveness.

","Under Joe Biden, the U.S. added 15.8 million jobs in 42 months, while Donald Trump’s term saw a loss of 2.7 million jobs due to the pandemic. Biden reduced the unemployment rate from 6.4% to 4.3%, compared to Trump’s increase from 4.7% to 6.4%. Wage growth has been slightly higher under Biden at 17% compared to Trump’s 15%, but Trump’s wage growth had a stronger impact relative to inflation.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present the budget in the Lok Sabha on February 1, 2025, emphasising modernizing railway infrastructure to meet growing passenger demands.
In the upcoming budget, Indian Railways is anticipated to take significant measures to boost the production capacity of passenger coaches across its production units in Chennai, Rae Bareli, and Kapurthala. In the financial year 2024-25,  54,113 crore was allocated for rolling stock, marking an increase of  156 crore compared to the actual expenditure during FY2023-24.
Ongoing Technological AdvancementsIndian Railways is actively implementing various technological upgrades to its passenger services. This includes the deployment of Vande Bharat Chair Car and Sleeper trains, Namo Bharat Rapid Rail, and Amrit Bharat Train services. Additionally, the operationalization of these advanced rolling stocksequipped with GPS, Wi-Fi, bio-toilets, real-time information systems, and upgraded interiorsis aimed at enhancing passenger experience.
One major initiative by Indian Railways is replacing older ICF coaches with safer and more comfortable Linke-Hofmann-Busch (LHB) coaches. ""Since April 2018, the national transporter has only produced LHB coaches,"" the report notes. However, challenges remain, as production targets for coaches during 2023-24 were not fully met, underscoring the need for capacity enhancements in the upcoming budget.
With rising demand for LHB coaches, which offer superior safety and comfort, the upcoming budget is likely to focus heavily on expanding and modernizing rolling stock to better serve passengers.
The acquisition of advanced locomotives, such as the WAG-12, exemplifies the railways' commitment to improving power output and operational efficiency. These advancements reflect Indian Railways' broader strategy to integrate modern technology into its fleet, ensuring reliability and comfort for travelers.
As India moves towards achieving greater efficiency and modernization across its railway network, the Union Budget 2025-26 is poised to be a pivotal moment for the national transporter in addressing its infrastructure and passenger service goals.","The Union Budget 2025-26 is expected to prioritize technological advancements in rolling stock.

Indian Express,2024-12-27 00:00:00,Liberalisation to RTI to Nuclear Deal: Five landmarks of Manmohan Singh’s journey,"The ‘91 liberalisation efforts
Singh became the Finance Minister during the PV Narasimha Rao tenure in 1991. At the time, India was facing a balance of payments crisis; had foreign exchange only for the purchase of two-three weeks of imports; and had to even mortgage its gold. Through his 1991 Budget, Singh brought in structural reforms as advocated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank; ended the licence raj system that made it difficult for businesses to operate; reduced tariffs and opened up the economy for private investment. Many on the Left criticised Singh’s reforms as paving the way for neoliberalism and the dictates of global capital, but the liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation package that Singh unveiled set the road map for economic growth in India.

The Indo-American Nuclear Deal
As Prime Minister of India, Singh invested heavily in the Indo-US civil nuclear deal, going to the extent of endangering his own government for it. In his first term in power — between 2004-2009 — Singh and the Congress were dependent on support from the Left parties who had 61 MPs in the Lok Sabha. CPI (M) general secretary Prakash Karat led the offensive against the Nuclear deal, accusing Singh of capitulation to Western powers. The BJP, too, was critical of it. The Left eventually pulled out of the government, necessitating a no-trust motion. But Singh stood his ground and survived a no-confidence motion.

As part of the deal, Singh cited India’s exemplary record in nuclear non-proliferation. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) approved the safeguards agreement with India on August 1, 2008. The US then approached the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) for an India-specific waiver to be able to start civilian nuclear trade. The NSG granted the waiver to India on September 6, 2008, allowing India access to civilian nuclear technology and fuel. The agreement was signed on October 10, 2008.

RTI, RTE, MNREGA
Singh’s government also brought landmark laws that were seen as empowering for citizens. The Right To Information (RTI) Act was introduced in 2005 and gave citizens the right to request information from public authorities.

The following year, Singh passed the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act that continues to guarantee 100 days of employment a year to every rural household in the country.

The Right to Education Act was passed in 2009, and guaranteed free and compulsory education for every child between the age of six and 14. In 2013, Singh passed the National Food Security Act to provide subsidised food grain to 75 per cent of rural population and 50 per cent of urban population.

Steering India through the 2008 crisis
Singh also helped India traverse and get through the global economic crisis of 2008. The government announced three stimulus packages in three months between December 2008 and February 2009, totalling Rs 1,86,000 crore, or 3.5 per cent of the GDP.

After doing better than what the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act had required in 2007-08, India’s fiscal deficit touched 6 per cent of the GDP in 2008-09. It was 2.7 per cent in the previous year.

Over seven months between October 2008 and April 2009, the RBI eased monetary conditions. Its unorthodox measures made available Rs 5,60,000 crore (about 9 per cent of the GDP) in domestic and external liquidity. The government continued with the stimulus packages in 2009-10 too, and the fiscal deficit touched 6.4 per cent of the GDP. The economy staged an impressive rebound. From 9 per cent-plus in the previous three years, it dropped to 6.7 per cent in 2008-09, and then bounced back to 8.5 per cent in 2009-10. The stimulus package was, however, not withdrawn after the crisis blew over.

Efforts for protecting minorities
Singh also stayed in the news for his initiatives for minorities. It was under his tenure that the government appointed both the Sachar Committee and the Ranganath Mishra Committee in the 2000s to address backwardness in the Muslim community. The Sachar Committee recommended multiple policies to ensure the development of Muslims, while the Mishra Committee recommended that SC status be made religion-neutral to provide benefits of reservation to Dalit converts to Islam.

At a meeting of the National Development Council in December 2006, where Chief Ministers of all states were present, Singh addressed the “potentialities and inherent strengths of our economy, while also addressing the areas of concerns”.

“I believe our collective priorities are clear. Agriculture, irrigation and water resources, health, education, critical investment in rural infrastructure, and the essential public investment needs of general infrastructure, along with programmes for the upliftment of SC/STs, other backward classes, minorities and women and children,” he said.

He went on to add that we would have to “devise innovative plans to ensure that minorities, particularly the Muslim minority, are empowered to share equitably in the fruits of development”.

“They must have the first claim on resources. The Centre has a myriad other responsibilities whose demands will have to be fitted within the overall resource availability. The Planning Commission will of course undertake a thorough review of ongoing programmes to eliminate those which have outlived their original rationale, but we cannot escape from the fact that the Centre’s resources will be stretched in the immediate future and an increasing share of the responsibility will have to be shouldered by the states,” he had said.","Manmohan Singh's tenure as Finance Minister in 1991 marked the beginning of India's liberalization, introducing key economic reforms that opened up the economy. As Prime Minister, he championed landmark laws like the RTI, RTE, and MNREGA, while also navigating India through the 2008 global financial crisis with multiple stimulus packages. Singh’s government also prioritized the welfare of minorities, appointing committees like the Sachar and Ranganath Mishra Committees to address the needs of the Muslim community. Additionally, his leadership secured the Indo-US nuclear deal, despite political opposition.",Politics,86,891

The Sikkim Express,2024-12-15 00:00:00,Which food should I eat?,"More people die due to over-nutrition.  We are now more dependent on artificial food, which is gastronomic of course, but from the point of nutrition and health only junk.  The food we live in today we would not like to give to our pets.  I think, nobody would like to feed their dogs with bread, butter, chocolates etc.  Nor would they like to give their cats tea and coffee heavily seasoned with cream and white sugar.  In order to make our food palatable we season them with different kind of condiments, which are highly corrosive to our delicate lining of stomach and duodenum.  We prefer to drink boiling hot tea or coffee which scalds our tongue and stomach.  

 

We try to make our food as attractive as possible to satisfy our palate.  Whether any food is wholesome or not, that is not our concern, but every food and drink of ours should look and taste nice.  Every cookery book we glance through we find that most of dishes recommended require an enormous quantity of butter, cream, eggs, meat, condiments, vinegar, red wine etc.  Even vegetarian dishes recommended are not free from the use of ghee (refined butter), condiments, high cholesterol dry fruits, white sugar etc. Moreover, to satisfy our palate, it has become customary for most of us to dine at least once a week with family members in some restaurants and hotels, where only junk foods are served.  It is not unlikely that most of the high profile chafes of five-star hotels may die of heart complaints if they are dependent for their daily calorie requirement on junk foods of hotels. I talked with a couple of chafes, they admitted, they preferred home-cooked food than the food of the hotels, where they are employed.


 

In fact, all the dishes mentioned in the cookery books require refined ingredients for their preparation, which are deprived of their most valuable food elements such as vitamins and essential minerals, which are so vital to build up our body.

 

Food articles’ manufacturers of today have caused us to live on artificialities and thus are playing a great deal of role to ruin our health.  Because of our dependence on these artificial food most of us look old early.  Our face becomes wrinkled, our bones become brittle (despite the fact that we take a lot of artificially manufactured calcium supplements) and we lose our teeth early and in an attempt to look young we go in for dentures and to hide our wrinkles we go in for selection of wrinkle-free creams and lotions.

 

Food experts and nutritionists have calculated that human beings need everyday so much protein, carbohydrates, fat etc.  Protein is indeed an essential element of our body, but its daily requirement cannot be calculated in terms of so much of meat, fish or eggs.  Calculation is simply an assumption, therefore it is misleading.  Our body is a complex mechanism; it cannot be fitted into any particular theory.  Let our body be allowed to develop in a natural way with intake of natural food!


 

Modern civilization’s artificial food has gifted the modern man with gastritis, chronic constipation, gastric and duodenal ulcers, appendicitis, colitis, goiter, severe nerve diseases, eye diseases, pyorrhea, cancer, and what not!

 

Meat, fish, eggs, white bread, and other concentrated foods, strongest tea, coffee, wine, spirits etc., which are preferred by modern men do not make one strong but internally weak gradually.  One can have remarkable results with health if simplified diet consisting of natural foods in natural condition replaces flesh, fish, fowl, white bread and artificial junk food.  If one cannot discard at a time flesh, fish, fowl etc. it is better one should cut down their intake gradually.


“Which is the best diet for me”, a question frequently asked by everyone.  As two people are not alike as regards their facial appearance and body’s construction, similarly not two peoples are alike in terms of their dietetic requirements.  Each individual has his own preferences as regards food.  Hence, so called “scientifically balanced diet” is a misnomer.

We normally eat what is being placed before us, when we are hungry.  Amongst the people those who can afford, their first course of menu is a soup.  The nutritional experts say that if we start with a course of soup, it will result in an increase in the secretion of the gastric juice.  After soup, we eat highly seasoned dishes which include non-vegan diet.  We finally conclude our menu with a hot drink, i.e., coffee.  No doubt, heat stimulates the process of digestion by increasing the supply of gastric juice as well as by attracting to the stomach more blood.  But this stimulation of stomach to overwork is only artificial and in due course, it will definitely have a negative effect in the normal functioning of the stomach.  Furthermore, the boiling hot food and drink coupled with the irritating condiments cause irreparable injury to stomach walls and duodenum and they also damage the liver and kidneys as well.  The ever-increasing number of deaths from diseases of the stomach, gallbladder, liver and kidneys testify to this fact.  Even the practice of taking tea and coffee frequently is fraught with serious consequences.  Caffeine the main alkaloid in tea and coffee blocks the absorption of iron and calcium in human body, also raises blood pressure and increases pulse rate.  The habit of tea and coffee is therefore not advisable.


In fact, diet depends on individual needs. It has no specific parameter to specify who needs what.  Hence, nutrition must be individual depending on the personal requirement.  It is better to switch over to taking whole-meal bread, unpolished rice, raw vegetables or lightly cooked vegetables, pulses, fruits, cane sugar, bran, light oil if possible only to take olive oil, avoid beverages like tea and coffee etc.  If possible for break-fast sprouted grains have to be taken, if they could not be taken raw then the same could be lightly boiled and taken with honey and little rock salt.
But this theory does not work in all cases.  Some people could neither digest roughage nor fruits. I have met some people whose digestive powers were so weak that they could not even digest boiled vegetables leave along pulses.  To restore their digestion, it becomes necessary to keep them for some time either exclusively on meat or fish diet.  This is only for treatment purpose and to reduce inflammatory condition of their abdomen.  However, once his normal condition is restored his stomach is to be gradually taught to digest normal food.  Meat, fish and eggs are not good for human body.  They do give nutrition, but with nutrition they give so much of toxicity to the system that human body finds difficult to throw it away.  This gradual accumulation of toxicity in course of time brings so many diseases that the body ultimately finds itself difficult to fight them out.  Even in cancer cases, if consumption of meat, fish and eggs is stopped totally the growth of the cancerous tissues could be stunted to a great deal. Those who suffer from chronic indigestion, they can preferably take before food two teaspoonful of yoghurt mixed in little water, which will quickly stimulate their digestive power, but these people will also need for sometime Vitamin B complex to repair their intestines, which normally become inflamed due to chronic indigestion leading to diarrhea.  


Nature has placed all the food elements and nutrients which we require into rice, wheat, barley, oats, gram and other grains.  Deficiency of one or the other essential nutrient we create in our body because of our ignorance as to in what way should we consume wheat, rice, barley, maize, potato, vegetables etc.  We prefer bran free wheat, polished rice, peeled vegetables, fried potatoes etc. – in terms of their nutritional value they are nil except for carbohydrates and trace minerals.  When we develop rickets, scurvy, bone deformation etc. we go to doctors and they term our diseases as deficiency diseases and prescribe some chemically prepared vitamin supplements and iron tablets.  It is high time that we imbibed the importance of food grains and vegetables in their natural condition and save ourselves from deficiency diseases.


Nutrition is not a science, as it is addressed today.  Diet to be chosen for a patient must be guided by instinct, commonsense and the effect of a particular food item on the body.  For a dietician this much of knowledge is absolutely essential, otherwise she will be a failure in her profession.  Before prescribing a diet the patient’s physical condition, his digestive capability, his taste and preferences and finally his disease have to be ascertained beforehand.  A random prescription of fruits, milk, vegetables, eggs, butter, honey, nuts etc. will have a disastrous effect on a convalescent body than to be of any help.  Abstract ideas will not help to select a right diet.  What Hippocrates wrote more than two thousand years ago that “an inferior diet liked by the patient is preferable to a superior diet which he dislikes” still holds importance.

Simple soaked and sprouted wheat, pressure cooked till soft and seasoned with milk, black treacle which is laxative and rich in iron, honey, stewed fresh fruit, boiled sultanas etc. is a highly nutritious diet for a convalescent patient and a growing child.  Bran pudding made with milk is also highly nutritious.  As far as possible, one should discard from one’s diet white sugar, white flour and refined salt.  White sugar, white flour and refined salt do not have any nutritive value since when they are refined all their nutritive elements are discarded.  The pure sea salt contains not only iodine but other elements which we need in infinitely small quantities.  Today iodized salt is being sold in the market which contains inorganic iodine but its effectiveness in terms of prevention of goiter is highly doubtful as inorganic compound is seldom being absorbed by the body, this iodized salt in the long run, this author has noted, has triggered cases of hypothyroidism.


Diet is rather an art and it should be practised accordingly, means that it should be arranged tentatively to a patient leaving a scope for future to change according to need.  Fasting is good for health, but an emaciated patient should not be allowed to fast.  Buddha had almost died of forty days’ fast.  Had there been no girl around to feed him with pudding and to make him realize that fasting would not bring anything substantial; the Buddha whom we venerate today would not be there.  Diet should commensurate with one’s capacity to digest and requirement.

 
Pure milk usually indigestible to many for it causes diarrhea to many and to others it causes violent spasms and cramps in stomach as it triggers indigestion.  Milk will be easily acceptable to the body, if plenty of water is added to it or it is added to puddings, custard or taken in the form of yoghurt.  In order to digest neat milk it should be taken slowly with a small teaspoon so that it is thoroughly salivated.  Toleration for milk can also be established by starting with small doses and increasing gradually, but before starting a milk diet, one very pertinent point is to be noted that our milkman is not injecting its cows with oxytocin in order to produce extra milk.  Oxytocin is a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland.  Oxytocin filters into the milk.  It is extremely toxic and affects the reproductive ability of women and girl children.   It also causes breasts to sprout early, period to start early or erratically, hair to grow in strange places on the face and also weakens sight and hearing.  Although the use of oxytocin is banned in India and the rest of the world for use in animals, it is still being used by profit oriented milkmen in India to make more money; I do not have much idea whether it is still being used in any country to procure more milk. Dairy farming is a highly competitive and lucrative market like poultry farming, and hence it’s use stealthily by certain vested people cannot be ruled out. Further, it should also be ensured that cow’s milk does not contain urea; it is frequently put into the fresh milk by milkmen to save it from being curdled by the movement of the truck when being carried.


These days preservatives and coloring agents are frequently used by the producers of readymade food.  Preservatives and artificial coloring agents are no doubt chemical compounds and harmful for the body, but in all packaged or tinned eatables and bottled food items we find an admixture of both the preservatives and coloring agents.  Therefore, before we go to buy any readymade food items, we must read the label and ensure that they do not contain either preservatives or coloring agents and if we find it otherwise on scrutiny we should not buy them.  Life is a precious gift of Nature; it should not be allowed to be extinguished on flimsy ground.

Before concluding a few words on the food value of poultry eggs can be discussed.  A poultry egg weights about 100 gm, which is equivalent to about 170 calories.  It contains about 13.6 percent protein and 13.3 percent of saturated fat.  In fact, each 100 gm of pulse (daal) contains not less than 24 percent of protein and less than 2 percent of unsaturated fat.  Eggs also contain an amino acid called Methionine, which destroys Vitamin B in the body.  Eggs also promote heart disease.  Each egg has upto 30,000 micro-pores on its outer shell, for transporting oxygen to the embryo inside.  These pores are susceptible to be contaminated with microbes if stored at a temperature above 30 degrees Fahrenheit.  Unless put into a fridge immediately after laid an egg becomes unfit for consumption.  A yellow yolk of an egg is the result of a chemical dye which is injected.  Poultry birds are mainly fed with the card-board waste and chopped up bodies of the male birds, hormones to produce more than one egg a day (since poultry farming is a competitive business), and antibiotics, such as Gentamycin, which is nephrotoxic (a substance that damages human kidneys), to keep it healthy in cramped cages.  All these poisons are passed into the eggs which we consume with relish.

There is no difference in fish which is served on our table.  The so called ‘fresh’ fish could be upto ten days old, if not more.  They are kept in ice and transported to different places.  Similarly, meat may be two to three days old.  In India, most of the cattle are tuberculosis infected.


The toxicity in non-vegan diets can easily be ascertained by the fact that within two to three hours of their consumption, we feel extremely thirsty, which fact has so far been ignored by all of us.  It is, in fact, a signal of our body that toxic elements are on the rise, and it wants to extricate these elements from our system.  In reality, both red and white meats are human killers because of their cholesterol content and other toxic elements whether it is poultry birds or veal or goat or pig – they are all the same.

Discussion on diet is endless.  If I go on incorporating more and more points, it will be a separate book, but that is not my objective.

We do not live to eat, but eat for our survival.  On the question of selection of a proper diet, my suggestion is this: one should not be overwhelmed by the theories of calories, proteins, vitamins, minerals etc. Diet should consist of curative aspect, and, hence whenever an absolute need is felt, it should be flexible enough to be changed.  Only diet is capable of doing miracles to a patient, and that wonderful knowledge can be acquired only by intuition and not by scientific tutoring.","The text critiques modern dietary habits, highlighting the shift from natural to artificial, processed, and overly refined foods that compromise health. Over-nutrition, junk foods, and harmful cooking practices are blamed for numerous chronic illnesses and premature aging. It advocates for natural, minimally processed foods like whole grains, fresh fruits, vegetables, and sprouted grains while condemning refined ingredients, excessive condiments, and junk food.  

The author critiques the reliance on artificial supplements and preservatives, asserting that balanced nutrition depends on individual needs rather than rigid dietary theories. It condemns practices like injecting livestock with hormones and using additives, which lead to toxic residues in food. Non-vegan diets, particularly meat, fish, and eggs, are criticized for their toxicity and health risks, including promoting cancer and heart disease.

goa chronicle,2024-07-08 00:00:00,The Only Good Terrorist is a Dead Terrorist,"In a world where the lines between good and evil are often blurred, the adage “the only good terrorist is a dead terrorist” has become a comforting mantra for many. It’s a simple, clear-cut solution to a complex problem, much like using a sledgehammer to swat a fly. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves; there’s a certain elegance to this perspective that demands closer examination.

First and foremost, let’s appreciate the sheer efficiency of this approach. Imagine the bureaucratic nightmare of rehabilitating terrorists. The endless paperwork, the reams of psychological evaluations, the tedious court proceedings—who has the time? Dead terrorists, on the other hand, require no such administrative hassle. They’re like nature’s perfect crime solution: silent, compliant, and wonderfully low-maintenance.
Of course, some might argue that the term “terrorist” is subjective. After all, one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. But who needs such moral relativism when we have the comforting binary of alive or dead? Why bother with nuanced distinctions when a bullet can do the talking?

Take, for instance, the ever-entertaining media coverage of a terrorist takedown. There’s something incredibly satisfying about the way news anchors announce these events with a mix of solemnity and barely concealed glee. The euphemisms are especially delightful: “neutralized,” “eliminated,” and “taken out”—each phrase more clinical and detached than the last. It’s almost as if we’re discussing pest control rather than human lives. And who can blame them? It’s so much easier to cheer for the hero when the villain is conveniently dehumanized.

Let’s not forget the economic benefits. Dead terrorists do not burden the taxpayers with expensive trials, incarceration costs, or de-radicalization programs. In a world where every penny counts, it’s crucial to prioritize. After all, why spend money on understanding the root causes of terrorism when we can invest in more efficient ways to end lives? Drones, precision missiles, and special ops teams—these are the true symbols of fiscal responsibility.
But there’s an even deeper satisfaction to be had from this approach. It taps into our most primal instincts. The black-and-white morality of “good vs. evil” resonates with us on a fundamental level. It’s the stuff of fairy tales, comic books, and blockbuster movies. Who doesn’t love a good showdown where the hero triumphs and the villain meets a fitting end? It’s straightforward, satisfying, and requires minimal thought. Plus, dead terrorists make for great political capital. Nothing boosts approval ratings like a decisive strike against the enemy.

Now, let’s consider the philosophical implications. By adopting the stance that “the only good terrorist is a dead terrorist,” we embrace a form of ethical absolutism. It’s a comforting thought that some actions are so heinous that they place the perpetrator beyond redemption. It simplifies the messy, complicated business of morality. No need for second chances, no risk of recidivism—just a clean, definitive end. It’s a tidy solution in an untidy world.


Moreover, this approach aligns perfectly with the fast-paced, results-oriented culture we live in. We crave immediate gratification, and what could be more gratifying than instant justice? Rehabilitation and understanding take time, patience, and empathy—qualities that are in short supply in today’s hustle-bustle society. A dead terrorist, on the other hand, offers the kind of quick fix we’ve come to expect from everything from fast food to internet speeds.
Critics might argue that this mindset perpetuates a cycle of violence, that it fails to address the underlying causes of terrorism, and that it dehumanizes individuals who might have been coerced or brainwashed into their actions. But why let such pesky details get in the way of a good soundbite? After all, the beauty of the slogan “the only good terrorist is a dead terrorist” lies in its simplicity. It cuts through the noise and offers a clear, unambiguous stance. It’s the kind of clarity that’s hard to come by in a world full of grey areas.

Furthermore, the entertainment value of this perspective cannot be overstated. Imagine the reality TV potential! “Terrorist Hunt: The Ultimate Showdown,” where elite teams track down and eliminate terrorists in high-octane, suspense-filled episodes. Viewers would be glued to their screens, rooting for the good guys and relishing the climactic confrontations. It’s a ratings goldmine waiting to happen.

Of course, satire aside, it’s important to recognize the real-world consequences of such a mindset. The reduction of complex human beings to one-dimensional caricatures, the disregard for due process, and the perpetuation of violence are serious issues that demand thoughtful consideration. But in the realm of satire, we can afford to indulge in the absurdity of it all, highlighting the contradictions and moral shortcuts that such a perspective entails.","The perspective of ""the only good terrorist is a dead terrorist"" is examined with a satirical lens, highlighting its perceived efficiency in solving complex issues with lethal force. It praises the simplicity of eliminating terrorists over the complexities of rehabilitation and due process, emphasizing immediate gratification and economic savings. The approach is portrayed as appealing due to its alignment with binary moralities and media-friendly narratives, likening terrorist elimination to pest control. However, the satire underscores the ethical absolutism, dehumanization, and potential perpetuation of violence inherent in such a stance, calling for deeper reflection on its real-world implications beyond its superficial appeal.",International News,101,770

The Navhinnd Times,2024-09-06 00:00:00,SC asks Speaker to dispose of disqualification plea by Nov ,"Staff Reporter

Panaji 

The Supreme Court has granted time till November 4 to Goa assembly Speaker Ramesh Tawadkar to dispose of a disqualification petition filed before him against eight MLAs, who had defected from the Congress and switched to the Bharatiya Janata Party in September 2022.

In an order passed in the plea filed by the then state Congress chief Girish Chodankar, the apex court said, “We hope and trust that the constitutional obligations will be discharged by the respondent (Speaker) by the next date of hearing.”

The next date of hearing is tentatively scheduled on November 4.

Chodankar filed the petition in the top court on account of the alleged failure of the Speaker to decide on the disqualification plea filed against the MLAs.

Chodankar has sought the disqualification of Digambar Kamat, Michael Lobo, Delilah Lobo, Kedar Naik, Aleixo Sequeira, Rajesh Faldessai, Rodolfo Fernandes and Sankalp Amonkar, stating that they voluntarily gave up the membership of their original party on whose behalf they had contested assembly polls and had been elected from their respective constituencies.

The High Court of Bombay at Goa in its judgment on May 2, 2023 recorded that the Speaker would decide on the disqualification petition expeditiously.

However, the disqualification plea has not been proceeded with by the Speaker any further, Chodankar said.","The Supreme Court has extended the deadline to November 4 for Goa Assembly Speaker Ramesh Tawadkar to rule on a disqualification petition against eight MLAs who defected from the Congress to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in September 2022.

2021 post-poll violence: SC raps CBI over its plea seeking transfer of cases outside West Bengal

The Supreme Court on Friday rapped the CBI for making ""scandalous allegations"" against the courts in its plea seeking transfer of cases relating to the 2021 post-poll violence cases outside West Bengal.

A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Pankaj Mithal said the agency cannot cast aspersions on the entire judiciary in West Bengal.

""Mr Raju what kind of grounds are taken in this? How can you cast aspersions on entire judiciary.You are showing as if there is a hostile environment in whole West Bengal.

""Your officers may not like the judicial officer or a particular state but don't say that the entire judiciary is not functioning. The judges the district judges and civil judges and sessions judges can't come here and defend themselves,"" the bench told Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, appearing for the CBI.

Defending the averments in the petition, the law officer told the apex court that there is no intention to cast aspersions and it is a case of loose drafting.

Raju withdrew the transfer petition after scathing observation from the apex court.

The top court recorded in its order, ""Scandalous allegations have been made against all the courts in general in West Bengal. It has been repeatedly averred that there is a hostile environment prevailing in the courts. It is very unfortunate that the central agency has chosen to cast aspersions on courts in West Bengal"".

""ASG states that there was no intention to cast aspersions. However the averment are to the contrary. He seeks permission to withdraw,"" the bench said.

The CBI had filed the petition in December 2023 seeking directions to transfer the cases outside of West Bengal due to alleged concerns of witness intimidation.","The Supreme Court criticized the CBI for its plea to transfer 2021 post-poll violence cases out of West Bengal, calling its claims ""scandalous"" and inappropriate. Justices Oka and Mithal emphasized that the CBI cannot undermine the entire judiciary in the state.

The Tribune,2024-08-19 00:00:00,Polls in J&K,"JAMMU and Kashmir’s decade-long wait for the Assembly polls is over, with the Election Commission announcing a three-phase polling schedule for the state-turned-UT. President’s rule, abrogation of Section 370, bifurcation of the state — J&K has seen it all. The delimitation exercise necessitated by the reorganisation has altered the electoral landscape — the Jammu region’s seat count has risen sizeably from 37 to 43, while the number of Assembly constituencies in Kashmir has gone up from 46 to 47. This will have a bearing on the election outcome and pre- or post-poll alliances.

The upcoming poll battle will be held against the backdrop of a series of terror attacks and encounters in the Jammu region. Terrorists have changed tack: they are targeting Hindu-dominated areas, while Muslim-majority Kashmir is no longer the epicentre of turbulence. In view of this shift, there is greater pressure on the BJP-led Central Government to ensure peaceful campaigning and polling. Elements inimical to India will try to disrupt the proceedings. The key is to create an environment conducive for the voter to come out and vote without fear. It will be a straightforward contest between the BJP and the Congress in Jammu. In contrast, the field is wide open in Kashmir, where the Abdullahs’ National Conference and the Muftis’ PDP will be in the fray along with Sajjad Lone’s J&K People’s Conference, Altaf Bukhari’s J&K Apni Party and former Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad’s Democratic Progressive Azad Party; independents with radical leanings can make the fight tougher.

In poll-bound Haryana, where the BJP has been in power for a decade, the Congress is looking to capitalise on the anti-incumbency factor. Both are fancying their chances, having won five seats each in the state in this year’s Lok Sabha elections. If the mandate is not decisive, things will boil down to the support of parties such as the Indian National Lok Dal and the Jannayak Janta Party.

Goa Chronicle ,2024-10-10 00:00:00,The Pot Calls the Kettle Black: America’s Sermons on Indian Black Ops,"In a truly breathtaking display of irony, the United States has taken it upon itself to lecture India on the ethics of black operations. Yes, the very same country that has perfected the art of clandestine interventions across the globe for over a century is now wagging its finger at New Delhi, expressing concern over India’s covert activities. One would think that Uncle Sam, with his black book of covert escapades on almost every continent, would know better than to play the moral guardian. Alas, the pot has decided to call the  kettle black—and in doing so, it reveals more about itself than it does about India.

The Gospel According to Langley

When it comes to black ops, America is not just a player; it’s the coach, referee, and tournament organizer all rolled into one. From Iran in 1953 to the Bay of Pigs fiasco, from the contrived coups in Latin America to the covert drone strikes in the Middle East, the U.S. has a rich and colorful history of black ops that reads more like a crime thriller than a diplomatic manual. This is the same country whose intelligence agency allegedly coined the term “plausible deniability” to wash its hands clean of nefarious deeds as if renaming a poison makes it any less lethal.

So, when Washington decides to put on the judge’s robe and lecture another country on covert operations, the absurdity is almost Shakespearean in its comic potential. It’s akin to a gambler with a lifetime casino membership warning a friend about the dangers of betting. Except, in this case, it’s not friendly advice but a self-righteous sermon, delivered with a straight face and a tone that suggests America’s covert track record is some kind of global gold standard.
A Black Ops Hall of Shame

Let’s take a moment to reminisce over some of America’s finest moments in the black ops hall of fame.

Who can forget the infamous Operation Ajax in 1953, which saw the CIA overthrow Iran’s democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh to secure Western oil interests? The covert meddling sparked a chain of events that led to the rise of a theocratic regime, leaving the region in turmoil. But hey, at least it was good practice for the decades of black ops that would follow.


And then there was the CIA’s involvement in Latin America during the Cold War, where the U.S. demonstrated that it wasn’t satisfied with merely being the world’s policeman—it also wanted to be its chief puppeteer. In the 1980s, the Iran-Contra affair saw the Reagan administration secretly funnel arms to Iran (a sworn enemy) to finance Nicaraguan rebels, all while preaching about the sanctity of democracy. The hypocrisy was so blatant that it required a government commission to whitewash the whole affair, thus pioneering a new genre of literature: ‘covert operations cleanup’. Or the recent coup in Bangladesh to overthrow Sheikh Hasina’s government to put a puppet of America.

The Drone in the Room

More recently, America’s moral compass seemed to short-circuit when it came to its favorite 21st-century pastime: drone strikes. If black ops have evolved with time, then drone warfare is their latest incarnation. With the click of a button, high-value targets (and sometimes wedding parties) can be vaporized without so much as a judicial warrant. America’s extrajudicial killings in Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia make James Bond look like a bureaucratic amateur tied up in red tape. But of course, these are not classified as “black ops”—they are “counter-terrorism measures,” thereby conferring a halo upon what would otherwise be called assassination.

The Righteous Indignation Over India’s Covert Footprints


Now, let’s get to the crux of the matter. Washington’s recent pearl-clutching over India’s alleged black ops activities, particularly concerning regional rivals, is steeped in the kind of selective amnesia that only comes from having your hands too deep in everyone else’s cookie jar. America suddenly finds it inappropriate that another nation might engage in covert actions to defend its national interests. The sermonizing seems less about India’s behavior and more about projecting American anxieties as the global geopolitical landscape shifts.

It is as if India, by engaging in covert operations (assuming the accusations are true), has broken some unwritten rule that says only America gets to play judge, jury, and executioner on the world stage. Perhaps Washington feels threatened by the idea that another country might employ tactics from the same clandestine playbook, forgetting that New Delhi, unlike Washington, doesn’t pontificate about human rights and democracy while simultaneously meddling in other nation’s internal affairs.
","The U.S. is ironically criticizing India for its covert operations, despite having a long history of clandestine interventions itself. From the 1953 coup in Iran to drone strikes in the Middle East, America's black ops track record is extensive. This moralizing appears hypocritical, as the U.S. seems threatened by India's actions, forgetting its own history of similar tactics while preaching about democracy.

The IMF, in its World Economic Outlook report released on October 2, had retained India’s gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecasts at 7 per cent and 6.5 per cent for FY25 and FY26, respectively. The financial agency said that pent-up demand accumulated during the Covid-19 pandemic has been exhausted as the economy “reconnects” with its potential growth. 
 
The Fund revised the growth, compared to its April forecast, by 0.2 percentage points amid rural consumption benefiting from an improved agricultural season, and public infrastructure investment continuing to expand While growth in Asia is expected to slow down in CY 2024 and CY 2025— reflecting fading support from the pandemic recovery and factors like ageing— short-term prospects were more favourable than expected in April, the regional economic outlook report said. 
 
The Asia and Pacific region is expected to contribute roughly 60 per cent to global growth this year. “This said, the outlook is subject to sizable economic and geopolitical uncertainties,” IMF said in its report.
 
A blog post released by IMF alongside the regional outlook said that while manufacturing has been the driver of growth in Asia, a transition to modern, tradable services could be a new source of growth and productivity. It said that the growth of services has already drawn about half of the region’s workers into the sector, up from just 22 per cent in 1990, as hundreds of millions moved from farms and factories. “This shift is likely to accelerate with further expansion of international trade in modern services such as finance, information, and communication technology, as well as business outsourcing, for example, as already done in India and the Philippines,” the blog post said. 
 
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her visit to the US for IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings had called for the need to explore alternative growth strategies and the types of jobs they will generate in addition to the traditional manufacturing-led development pathway.Sitharaman, in discussion on how the World Bank can help create more jobs, had said that jobs are the most pressing global issue, given the continued economic headwinds and rapid technological change that are redefining the skills required for youth to enter the job market.","India continues to be the world's fastest-growing economy, driven by investment and private consumption, according to the IMF's Regional Economic Outlook for Asia-Pacific.

The growth forecast was revised upward by 0.2 percentage points due to improved rural consumption and ongoing public infrastructure investment.

While growth in Asia is expected to slow down in 2024-2025 due to factors like ageing populations and the fading effects of the pandemic recovery, short-term prospects have improved. The Asia-Pacific region is set to contribute about 60% of global growth this year, but the outlook remains uncertain due to geopolitical and economic risks.

The IMF also highlighted the shift from manufacturing to modern services, such as finance and ICT, as a potential new source of growth and productivity in Asia. This transition has already drawn millions of workers into the services sector, particularly in countries like India and the Philippines.

The Arunachal Front,2024-09-17 00:00:00,Arunachal: Khandu Participates in a Walkathon to mark the beginning of Swacchata Hi Seva 2024 campaign,"ITANAGAR-  Chief Minister Pema Khandu today participated in a walkathon organized from Dera Natung Govt College ground to the D K Convention Center near I G Park, marking the beginning of Swacchata Hi Seva 2024, a nationwide cleanliness initiative that aims to promote cleanliness and sanitation across India.

On the occasion Khandu emphasized on the significance of Mahatma Gandhi’s mantra of three types of cleanliness – of the mind, of the body and the surrounding “Gandhiji had called for a clean mind, a clean body and a clean surrounding upon which this Swachchta Hi Seva campaign is based on. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, launched by PM Narendra Modi has changed the mindset of us Indians towards cleanliness. Many missions were carried on under this campaign and today we have attained 100% open defecation free state status,” he said.

While informing that the Swachhata Hi Seva, a yearly swachhata campaign, was started in the year 2017 to strengthen voluntarism and collective action in swachhata. Khandu underscored the importance of this year’s theme. “This year the theme ‘Swabhav Swachhata-Sankar Swachhata’ is all the more important as we are completing a significant milestone commemorating the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) which was launched in 2014,” he said.

He added that the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has turned into a National Movement whereby a sense of responsibility has been evoked among the people and drew attention towards another important aspect of the campaign – scientific management of solid waste. “India generates more than 10th of the world’s waste and cleaning this waste is one of the most challenging task. To this effort, the state Govt has so far set up 12 Material Recovery Facilities in the State and to make these fully operational we are providing machineries and equipment,” Khandu informed.

He appreciated the Itanagar Municipal Corporation for operationalizing the Septage Treatment Plant for scientific management of faecal sludge treatment in the Capital.“Similarly, we are also planning to set up Liquid Waste Treatment plant in all the districts in a phased manner to ensure that there is no discharge of contaminated grey waters in the paddy fields, streams and rivers,” Khandu said.

He called upon all, especially the youths, to always remember that Swachhata Hi Seva or cleanliness should not be just one-time activity but it should be continuous effort that requires participations of each and every member of the society.
“Swachhata Hi Seva is not a mere government programme, it is a movement that empowers citizens to take ownership of their surroundings and work towards cleaner environment for us instead of only relying on the govt alone,” the Chief Minister added.

In line with the campaign’s goals, Khandu urged each individual to dedicate 100 hours a year to cleanliness activities, promoting discussions within families and villages about the importance of maintaining clean surroundings.

“As we begin the Swachhata Hi Seva movement, culminating on October 2, Gandhi Jayanti, we look forward to a 14-15 day cleanliness drive to reinforce Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of a clean India, a vision strongly advocated by Prime Minister Modi since the launch of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in 2014,” he added.

The event was also joined by Home Minister Mama Natung, RD & Panchayati Raj Minister Ojing Tasing, Urban Affairs Minister Balo Raja, Itanagar legislator Techi Kaso, IMC Mayor Tame Phassang, Chief Secretary Manish Kumar Gupta and others.

","ITANAGAR: Chief Minister Pema Khandu kicked off the Swachhata Hi Seva 2024 campaign by participating in a walkathon from Dera Natung Govt College to D K Convention Center.

Indian Express,2024-10-30 00:00:00,Beware: How scammers are using AI to sound like your loved ones – 3 tips to stay safe,"Received a call from an unknown number claiming that your friend or a family member has been arrested or involved in an accident? Chances are it's a scammer using AI voice cloning tool to dupe you of your money.Sunil Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Airtel recently revealed that scammers are cloning his voice using AI and calling company executives to transfer a large sum of money. At the NDTV World Summit, the businessman said that the AI-cloned voice was so convincing that he was stunned after hearing the recording.

While the company official did not fall for the voice clone scam, scammers successfully used voice cloning to dupe people of their money. With AI voice cloning scams on the rise, there have been several instances in the last few months where people have lost anywhere between a few thousand to more than a lakh.

What is AI voice cloning?
AI voice cloning is a technology that uses AI to create a digital replica or copy of a person’s voice. The process involves recording a person’s voice and then training an AI model to impersonate that person.AI voice cloning has a wide range of useful applications in sectors like creating realistic voice options for text-to-speech, offering personalised customer interactions, and creating educational materials. However, the technology can also used by fraudsters to impersonate someone in your family and in some cases, impersonate kids’s voices and dupe parents of their money by telling them they are implicated in a criminal case.

How easy is it to clone someone’s voice?
Using artificial intelligence-powered tools to clone someone’s voice is fairly easy. Just run a quick search on Google and you will be greeted with several free and paid services that charge as low as $5 (approx. Rs 420) to clone a person’s voice.All you need to clone someone’s voice is a 30-second clip of the voice you want to replicate. Upload that audio clip on one of the many voice cloning services available, follow a bunch of steps and you will be able to say anything in their voice.

How do AI voice clone scams work?
Even if you are aware of most modern scams like YouTube like-to-earn scams, WhatsApp job offerings and others, AI voice cloning scams can be convincing since they often involve your friends, someone you know or someone in your family.Scammers often impersonate law officials like policemen or officials from known government agencies like the Narcotics Control Bureau claiming that your friend, relative or kid has been held in custody in a criminal case. In some instances, scammers may also claim that someone you know is involved in an accident and ask for money on an unknown number so they can take them to the hospital.

These scammers lure victims by creating a fake sense of urgency and demanding that you immediately transfer some money for their release. In cases where parents were duped by scammers using AI voice cloning to impersonate their children, parents say that they heard their children crying over the phone and that they sound exactly like his voice, which is something that can be really convincing even if you are wary of such scams.

How to identify AI Voice Cloning scams?
1. Check the country code

While some fraudsters may reside in India, people who lost money to the scam say that many times, the phone number starts from +92, which is the country code for Pakistan. Scammers have been duping people from Pakistan for quite some time now, with some reports dating back to 2010.Any Indian government official, be it the police or other law enforcement agencies will call from a number that starts from +91, which is India’s country code. Also, if anyone tells you that you have been put on a ‘Digital Arrest’ and that you have to stay in front of the screen for hours, it is a scam.

2. Call or talk to the person if possible

In case you get a call from an unknown number claiming to be in touch with someone you know, avoid sending any money unless you talk to that person talk to them for a few minutes. If possible, call the person the scammer is referring to and check the details to see if there is any truth or if someone is impersonating them.

3. Change in speaking tone and inconsistent speech patterns

If you notice any stutters, delayed replies, robotic speech tones or changes in speaking tone, chances are the other person is likely is not real. While AI voice cloning tools are pretty good at maintaining the natural flow of the conversation, they often fumble when it comes to replying to unscripted or answering spontaneous questions.To know if it is a real person on the other side, ask them about things like what time they usually come home, names of the people live with or other personally identifiable information that you can use to determine if is a real person or an AI on the other end.An easy way to determine if the caller is using AI voice cloning to impersonate an individual is that you won’t hear any breathing during the conversation. Also, AI-generated speech lacks any acceleration or deacceleration in talking speed, so if someone on the call is talking at the same speed without taking a breath or pausing, it is likely the work of artificial intelligence.In the coming years, generative AI capabilities are only going to get better, and future versions of such AI voice cloning tools will be more accurate at replicating human emotions and speech. So, even if you are wary of such scams, we advise you to avoid picking up calls from unknown numbers, especially ones that do not start with the +91 prefix. Also, before performing any financial transaction, make sure to verify their identity.","AI voice cloning technology creates digital replicas of a person's voice, making it alarmingly easy for scammers to impersonate individuals using only a short audio clip. These fraudsters often claim that a friend or family member has been involved in an accident or arrested, exploiting a sense of urgency to extract money from victims. Notable cases, like that of Bharti Airtel's chairman Sunil Mittal, illustrate how convincing these scams can be, leading to people losing significant sums of money.

Identifying AI voice cloning scams involves several key strategies: 

1. Check the country cod : Many scams originate from numbers starting with +92 (Pakistan), while legitimate calls within India will start with +91. 
   
2. Verify through direct communication : Before sending money, contact the person supposedly in distress to confirm their situation.

3. Look for inconsistencies : Signs of robotic speech, such as a lack of natural breathing and unusual speech patterns, indicate a potential scam. 

As generative AI improves, vigilance is essential. Avoid answering unknown calls and always authenticate identities before making financial transactions.",Science and Technology,174,972

Goa cannot be compared with Thailand,' added Khaunte.
""People come to Goa for what it is. More importantly, Goas beauty and creativity and other things cannot be compared with Thailand. We dont want to experience a Thailand in Goa, said Rohan Khaunte at a press conference in the state on Thursday, January 2, 2025.
The tourism minister claimed that five-star hotels in Goa had recorded around 100 per cent occupancy. Rohan Khaunte's comments come after a viral social media post in November, claiming that foreign tourists have abandoned the state, triggered a hotbed of reactions about Goa's infrastructure.
Do not disturb Goa with smaller issuesAlthough Rohan Khaunte admitted that any tourist visiting Goa faced issues with connectivity, getting a taxi, he claimed these were smaller issues. "" I am not justifying the issues, but at the same time, we need to ensure that a wrong message is not created by someone. Let us amplify the right issues. Let us not disturb Goa with smaller issues when it is a tourism destination, said Khaunte.
Goan cabbies are known to often charge passengers exorbitantly, demanding around  1500-1800 for a trip that should cost  500. In an interview with the TOI in September 2024, Goa Transport Minister Mauvin Godinho also admitted that the biggest problem with Goa's transport were the state's taxis.
Goa sees less foreign arrivalsIt is not just the taxis. A quick search on Goa on X shows several users posting about a host of issues with the tourist spot. From exorbitant hotel prices, a tourist being beaten to death, to tourists preferring Sri Lanka over Goa, several reasons can be attributed to the declining foreign arrivals in the state.
The number of domestic tourists visiting Goa rose from approximately 5.2 million in 2015 to over 8.5 million in 2023. In 2019, Goa hosted nearly 9.4 lakh foreign tourists.

Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd has spent USD 13 billion on acquisitions in the past five years across new energy, telecom, retail and media business to script a pivot away from core oil and petrochemicals business to clean energy and consumer facing verticals.

 Last week, Reliance bought oncology platform Karkinos Healthcare for Rs 375 crore, adding another stack to its diagnostic and digital healthcare ecosystem, Morgan Stanley said in a report.

 ""Over the past five years, RIL has announced USD 13 billion in acquisitions with 14 per cent in new energy, 48 per cent in technology, media and telecommunications (TMT), 9 per cent in retail, and increasingly more in healthcare,"" it said.

 Of this, USD 6 billion was in acquisition of companies and assets in media and education business and USD 2.6 billion in telecom and internet verticals. It spent USD 1.7 billion on acquisitions in new energy and USD 1.14 billion in retail, according to Morgan Stanley.

 RIL's biggest acquisition in the last five years has been buyout of local cable TV and internet service providers Hathway Cable and Datacom Ltd for USD 981 million. It spent USD 771 million on buying Norwegian-headquartered solar panel maker REC Solar Holdings and another USD 767 million on buying search and database firm JustDial, the report said.

 Last week, it acquired a 100 per cent stake in Karkinos Healthcare, increasing its exposure to the diagnostic and healthcare ecosystem following previous investments like HAGI, Netmeds and Strand Life Science.

 Karkinos provides technology driven, innovative solutions for early detection, diagnosis and management of cancer, according to Morgan Stanley.

 It acts like a care partner during a patient's cancer treatment.

 Other investors in the company have included Tata Group, Rakuten, Mayo Clinic, and Hero Enterprise.

 ""RIL aims to leverage its technological expertise and vast distribution networks to create more integrated healthcare system-digital health platforms, telemedicine services and advanced healthcare delivery models,"" the brokerage said.

 Karkinos was incorporated in India on July 24, 2020 and is in the business of providing technology-driven, innovative solutions for the early detection, diagnosis, and management of cancer. It had a turnover of about Rs 22 crore in the 2022-23 fiscal year.

 Karkinos has cancelled the existing outstanding 30,075 equity shares held by the erstwhile shareholders of the company. Its previous prominent investors included Ewart Investments Ltd (100 per cent subsidiary of Tata Sons), Reliance Digital Health Ltd (a subsidiary of Reliance Industries), Mayo Clinic (US), Sundar Raman (Director at Reliance Foundation Youth Sports and former COO of Indian Premier League since 2008), and Ravi Kant (ex-MD of Tata Motors).

 The company is focused on providing end-to-end services relating to early detection and effective treatment of cancer at substantially lower than prevailing rates, while still generating healthy profitability. In order to meet this vision, Karkinos started partnering with hospitals to provide oncology services (testing, radiation therapy, etc.).

 The company has partnered with around 60 hospitals till December 2023. It is through a subsidiary setting up a 150-bed multispecialty cancer hospital at Imphal, Manipur. Going forward, its source of income was said to be via Advanced Cancer Care Diagnostics and Research (ACCDR), Distributed Cancer Care Network (DCCN), tie-ups with corporates for early diagnosis of cancer, and cancer care hospital.","Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has made strategic acquisitions totaling USD 13 billion over the past five years, shifting its focus from traditional oil and petrochemicals to clean energy, telecommunications, retail, and healthcare.

Indian Express,2025-01-01 00:00:00,"AI chip race, antitrust challenges, and culture wars: What lies ahead for Big Tech in 2025","As we step into 2025, here’s a closer look at what is in store for some of the biggest players in the tech industry.2024 was the year that big tech companies staked a lot of their future on artificial intelligence. The bulk of AI spending came from tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Google’s parent company, Alphabet, with their AI-fuelled capital expenditures surging to a combined $170 billion (up 56 per cent YoY) through the third quarter of 2024, according to a report by Forbes.

The accelerated spending on AI reflects how each big tech company sought to define its own competitive edge in 2024. While Amazon unveiled a new generation of AI models and said that it is building the world’s largest AI compute cluster, Apple leaned into offering personalised AI features on its devices. Meta upgraded its Ray-Ban smart glasses with AI capabilities, and its open-source AI models drew widespread attention.

Microsoft solidified its position with AI-integrated Office tools, but the year was not without challenges, as the company faced a massive Windows systems outage.  Google released AI models and features in Search to fend off newer competitors such as Perplexity and OpenAI, even as it grappled with a major antitrust setback in the courtroom.Tech giants are hungry for nuclear energy to fuel the vast data centres driving the AI takeover. In 2024, Google inked the first-ever corporate agreement to buy nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors (SMRs) that will be built and operated by Kairos Power, a US-based energy company.

Amazon also announced that it is investing over $500 million of its own money to develop SMRs. A shuttered nuclear reactor at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, US, is being reactivated to power Microsoft’s AI-driven, data centre energy needs. Meta is seeking proposals from nuclear power developers to help meet its AI and sustainability goals.

While there is still a long way to go before the pivot to nuclear energy fully begins, tech giants will continue laying the groundwork for nuclear-powered data centres in 2025. We might also see more of these deals this year.","As we enter 2025, AI will remain central to the tech industry's evolution. In 2024, major companies like Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet collectively invested $170 billion in AI, a 56% increase from the previous year. This surge underscores their commitment to AI-driven progress. Amazon introduced new AI models and a vast compute cluster, while Apple personalized AI features for its devices. Meta enhanced its Ray-Ban smart glasses with AI and released open-source models. Microsoft integrated AI into Office tools, despite facing challenges like a Windows outage. Google strengthened its Search capabilities to compete with emerging players.

A growing trend is the shift towards nuclear energy to power the AI infrastructure. In 2024, Google secured a deal to purchase nuclear energy from small modular reactors (SMRs), and Amazon pledged over $500 million to develop its own SMRs. Microsoft reactivated the Three Mile Island reactor, while Meta explored nuclear energy for its sustainability goals.

the new indian express,2024-09-25 00:00:00,"Ottawa backstabbed India in Khalistani investigation row, says recalled Indian Ambassador to Canada ","NEW DELHI: Calling Canada's behaviour ""the pits"", India's recalled high commissioner Sanjay Verma says India was back-stabbed and treated in a most unprofessional manner by a country that is supposed to be a friendly democracy.

In an unexpected downturn of relations, Verma was declared a ""person of interest"" by Canada last week in its investigation into the June 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian citizen who has been declared a Khalistani terrorist by India.

Before Canada could take further action, New Delhi recalled Verma and five other diplomats who were also similarly named.

""This is the pits. This is the most unprofessional approach to a bilateral relation. There are diplomatic tools available in the hands of a diplomat. Those tools could have been used"" instead of seeking to interrogate a country's top envoy and other diplomats, Verma said in an interview to PTI Video recorded on Wednesday, his first after returning to India.
Sanjay Verma, Indian envoy recalled from Canada, during an interview with PTI, in New Delhi, Wednesday.
Some Liberal MPs ask Canadian PM Justin Trudeau to resign, urge him not to seek fourth term

Speaking on a wide range of issues at PTI's New Delhi studios, Verma spoke about the genesis of the Khalistani movement in Canada, the support it has been getting from local politicians for electoral gains, and the kind of criminal activities the Khalistanis carry out in order to increase their numbers.

""A child that cries the most gets fed first by the mother. Similarly, even though they are only a handful, they shout the most and get the most attention from Canadian political backers,"" he said.

Verma said that extreme hard-line Khalistanis are only about 10,000 in number, and supporters amount to perhaps 1 lakh in a Sikh population of about 8 lakhs.

""To get support they intimidate commons Sikhs there, including with threats such as 'we know where your daughter is studying'"" Verma said.

""The Khalistanis have made Khalistan into a business in Canada. In the name of Khalistan, they do human trafficking, drug trafficking, gun-running and all. They earn a lot of money through that and also through gurudwaras and they use part of that money for all nefarious jobs,"" he said.

""All the dirty things that you can think of they are involved.""

Recalling the events leading up to the diplomatic dust-up, Verma said he was at the Toronto airport on October 12 when when he received a message from the Canadian foreign ministry asking him to come to their office the same evening.

Since he was flying back that evening, Verma sought time on October 13 when he went to the Global Affairs Canada (foreign ministry) office with his deputy high commissioner.

""After a bit of conversation they told me that I along with five other Indian diplomats and officials, are 'persons of interest' in the inquiry of killing of Nijjar. And, therefore there was a request to waive off my diplomatic immunity as well as diplomatic immunity of my colleagues, so that we could be interrogated by RCMP which is this Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the investigating agency there. So, I took that as a message,"" Verma said.

""It doesn't happen in diplomacy. Generally speaking, there will be some kind of messaging to start with. I didn't get that either. And, all of a sudden this was handed over to us. So, I would say this demonstrates the distrust, this demonstrates a kind of backstabbing that was done to us by our very professional colleagues in Canada,"" he said in the first detailed account of the traumatic hours before he and his colleagues had to pack up in a hurry and leave Canada.

""Both are democracies, both are countries of rule of law. We have a huge diasporic interest in Canada. We are good trading partners, investment partners, etc. So, we had been doing well in the overall canvas of our bilateral relations. And, this came to me as a shock,"" he added.

Asked how he took the developments, Verma said: ""My face did not betray any emotion, not even a wrinkle of worry... I was happy about the fact that I did not give them a sense of feeling that this man was sad, or that I was afraid.""","India's recalled High Commissioner to Canada, Sanjay Verma, criticized Canada's handling of the diplomatic situation surrounding the Hardeep Singh Nijjar investigation, calling it ""the pits"" and ""unprofessional."" Verma stated that Canada's request to waive his and other diplomats' immunity for interrogation regarding Nijjar's killing was unexpected and a breach of diplomatic protocol. He felt ""back-stabbed"" by this approach from a supposedly friendly nation. Verma also commented on the Khalistani movement in Canada, suggesting it is a small but vocal group that gains political attention and engages in criminal activities like human trafficking and drug smuggling.

Hindustan Times,2024-12-24 00:00:00,Trump picks Indian-American entrepreneur as senior artificial intelligence policy adviser,"Washington : US President-elect Donald Trump has appointed a prominent Indian-American technologist, Sriram Krishnan, as the senior policy advisor for artificial intelligence at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.

In this capacity, Krishnan will work closely with Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, and have a say in shaping the wider policy landscape around AI. While the Joe Biden administration made it a key priority to highlight the possible risks of AI and draw a policy framework that limited harm, the incoming Trump administration has viewed AI primarily through the lens of an opportunity, prioritised the ideas of growth and innovation and been publicly critical of regulatory attempts as an attempt by bigger tech firms to stymie the growth of smaller tech firms.

Announcing the appointment, Trump said that his tech policy team “will unleash scientific breakthroughs, ensure America’s technological dominance, and usher in a Golden Age of American Innovation!” He posted on Truth Social, “Working closely with David Sacks, Sriram will focus on ensuring continued American leadership in A.I., and help shape and coordinate A.I. policy across Government, including working with the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology.”

Krishnan said that he was honoured to be able to serve his country and “ensure continued American leadership in AI”.

Krishnan, 40, was born in Chennai and did his bachelors in technology at SRM university. He worked in Microsoft between 2005 and 2011 where his focus was Windows Azure. From 2013 to 2016, he worked in what was then Facebook, where he led strategy and execution across businesses in mobile monetisation and created Facebook Audience Network. Krishnan then went on to work on product at Snap and Twitter before branching off to become an investor. In 2020, he became a general partner at the venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, which invests both in seed and late stage tech companies. It is here that Krishnan has closely worked with AI, consumer and crypto firms, and worked with governments on AI policy.

Krishnan, in his current role, worked closely with the founder of the VC, Marc Andreessen, who is a key Trump supporter. He also has a good relationship with top Trump advisor and supporter, Elon Musk, and is an investor in X and SpaceX. Along with his wife, Krishnan also hosts the Aarthi and Sriram show featuring conversations with Silicon Valley’s top technologists and entrepreneurs.

Krishnan’s appointment may also leave an imprint on the debate on immigration. While the Trump ecosystem is fiercely opposed to illegal immigration, the tech constituency within Trump’s coalition is a strong advocate of continued legal immigration as a way to sustain American tech dominance, with Trump committing on a tech podcast with Sacks during the campaign that he was even in favour of giving green cards to those who studied in the US.

In a post on X earlier this month, Krishnan offered a glimpse into his worldview and listed out specific suggestions to improve entrepreneurship. These included creating a startup founder or entrepreneur visa category, allowing H1B visa holders to start companies or transition to entrepreneur visa, and fast tracking green cards for technical fields. On crypto, he suggested clarity on the legal definition and departmental jurisdiction, a task that Trump has now assigned to a newly created crypto council. Krishnan also recommended creating a real time payment system for instant transfers, giving the example of UPI in India.

With Usha Vance serving as the Second Lady, Vivek Ramaswamy co-heading the Department of Government Efficiency, Kash Patel running the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Harmeet Dhillon in charge of civil rights at the Department of Justice, and now Krishnan playing a key role in AI policy, from January 20, the Donald Trump administration is all set to have desis in key positions that will shape American state, security, science and the world.

Commenting on Krishnan’s appointment, Sanjeev Joshipura of Indiaspora, a leading diaspora group, said, “For several years, Sriram has been an insightful thinker and influential commentator in the artificial intelligence realm. His previous work blending public policy, international affairs, investing and technology will stand him in good stead as he serves the nation in this important role. As Indiaspora continues our convening and thought leadership work on AI in the United States and abroad, we look forward to engaging closely with Sriram.”","US President-elect Donald Trump appointed Indian-American technologist Sriram Krishnan as Senior Policy Advisor for AI at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Krishnan, born in Chennai and a former Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, and Twitter executive, brings expertise in AI, crypto, and tech policy. He will collaborate with AI czar David Sacks to shape policies prioritizing innovation and growth. A venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz, Krishnan has strong ties to Elon Musk and Trump supporters. His appointment highlights the Trump administration's pro-innovation stance and could influence immigration, advocating visas for entrepreneurs and tech professionals to sustain US tech leadership.",International News,101,722

Indian Express,2024-10-04 00:00:00,Supreme Court not to hear NEET PG case today,"The Supreme Court will today not be hearing the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test Postgraduate (NEET PG) case.

A three-judge bench, led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud and including Justice Manoj Misra and Justice JB Pardiwala, heard the case on September 20 regarding the normalisation of marks, answer keys, and the results of the medical entrance exam.

Students have raised concerns about the transparency of results and normalisation process followed by the National Board of Examinations for Medical Sciences (NBEMS). The petition was submitted on September 7 and was earlier heard on September 13.

The plea, filed by Ishika Jain and others, seeks the disclosure of answer keys, question papers of NEET PG 2024, and standardisation of marks as the test was split into two parts for ensuring transparency in the selection process.

When asked why NBE never releases answer keys, an official earlier told the indianexpress.com that since medicine has niche and nuanced areas, it can become difficult to generate new questions.

Senior Advocate Vibha Datta Makhija and Advocate Tanvi Dubey who are representing the NEET PG aspirants claimed that there were last-minute changes made by NBEMS related to the exam pattern.

This year, NEET PG was conducted in two shifts instead of the usual single-shift format. The exam took place on August 11 in two shifts: first from 9 am to 12:30 pm and the next from 3:30 to 7 pm. With the new system in place, the Board had to adopt a normalization process.

“NBEMS has adopted the process currently used by AIIMS-New Delhi for its various examinations conducted in more than one shift, including but not limited to INI-CET, in preparation of the result for NEET-PG 2024,” the official NBEMS notice stated.","The Supreme Court will not hear the NEET PG case today.

Financial Express ,2024-08-27 00:00:00,"As Y chromosome nears extinction, will men disappear from Earth?","A new study has revealed that human Y chromosome may disappear in a few million years. Y chromosome is crucial to determine the sex of human and as it is degenerating, will this lead to our extinction?
In humans, females have two X chromosomes and males have a single X and a puny little chromosome called Y. The X contains about 900 genes that do all sorts of jobs unrelated to sex. Y contains few genes (about 55) and a lot of non-coding DNA and it also contains an all-important gene that kick-starts male development in the embryo.
When compared with Platypus, XY pair is just an ordinary chromosome, with two equal members. This suggests the mammal X and Y were an ordinary pair of chromosomes not that long ago.

The researchers believe that Y chromosome has lost 900–55 active genes over the 166 million years that with the evolution. That’s a loss of about five genes per million years. At this rate, the last 55 genes will be gone in 11 million years, they claim.
To understand the impact of disappearing Y chromosome and the what the future holds, scientists analysed two rodent lineages that have already lost their Y chromosome – and are still surviving. 
According to a report by Science Alert, the mole voles of eastern Europe and the spiny rats of Japan each boast some species in which the Y chromosome, and SRY, have completely disappeared. The X chromosome remains, in a single or double dose in both sexes.

A team led by Hokkaido University biologist Asato Kuroiwa conducted a study to spiny rat and discovered most of the genes on the Y of spiny rats had been relocated to other chromosomes. Surprisingly, they found no sign of SRY, nor the gene that substitutes for it.
They found that tiny difference near the key sex gene SOX9, on chromosome 3 of the spiny rat. A small duplication (only 17,000 base pairs out of more than 3 billion) was present in all males and no females, Science Alert reported. According to the researchers, this small duplicated DNA contains the switch that normally turns on SOX9 in response to SRY. When they introduced this duplication into mice, they found that it boosts SOX9 activity, so the change could allow SOX9 to work without SRY, Science Alert reported.
These findings suggest that new sex determining gene may come with human evolution but it has its own set of risks too. The findings of the study were published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science journal.","The Y chromosome, which determines male biological sex, has been shrinking over millions of years, leading to concerns that it might eventually disappear. This could hypothetically mean the extinction of men, as the Y chromosome carries genes essential for male development. However, scientists suggest that even if the Y chromosome were to vanish, it wouldn't necessarily lead to the extinction of men. Some mammals, like certain rodents, have lost their Y chromosomes but still have males. This is because other parts of their genome have taken over the role of determining sex. In humans, it's possible that another chromosome or genetic mechanism could evolve to take over the functions of the Y chromosome if it were to disappear. While the idea of the Y chromosome becoming extinct raises interesting biological questions, it's unlikely that men would completely disappear from Earth due to genetic evolution and adaptability.",Science and Technology,146,427

The Sports and Youth Services Department in a notification issued on July 19 (Friday) replaced the existing Biju Patnaik Awards for Sports, Bravery, and State Awards with Odisha State Sports Award. The revised guidelines for the awards now include eight categories, compared to the previous five.

The change in nomenclature has not gone down well with the BJD which termed the action narrow and revengeful.
Arun Sahoo, Nayagarh MLA and BJD spokesperson, said, “Late Biju Patnaik was a legendary figure in Indian politics. The BJP government has renamed the State sports award that was previously conferred in his honour. This decision reflects BJP’s narrow political perspective”.

“The BJP should refrain from engaging in this type of politics. It is unclear what the BJP government hopes to gain by dropping the name of Biju Patnaik, who is a revered figure in Odisha and respected by all political parties. Biju Patnaik worked alongside the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee and made significant contributions to the Indian freedom struggle,” Mr. Sahoo said.

Responding to BJD’s objection, Sajjan Sharma, BJP spokesperson, said, “The State awards, schemes or institutions should transcend individual title and must not be treated as the personal property of any single family. Many leaders have worked tirelessly to protect the interests of Odisha, yet they have not received the recognition they deserve.

Institutions such as Biju Patnaik University of Technology and Biju Patnaik Open Air Ashrma (open air jail) too have been named after the legendary leader.

indian express,2024-07-18 00:00:00,Elevating our education ecosystem for tomorrow,"Sahil Gupta and Guncha Prakash

The Indian education sector is at a crucial crossroads today, reflecting a landscape of opportunities and challenges. The National Education Policy (NEP) is nearing the completion of its fourth year and will continue to act as a guiding blueprint, broadly laying down the strategic direction and shared objectives for all stakeholders in the sector.

While budgetary allocations for improving infrastructure, quality, and access to education have increased over the last three years (Rs 1.12 lakh crore in FY 2024 as against Rs 99,300 crore in FY 2021), the allocation for Research and Development (R&D) continues to stand at an abysmal level of 0.7 per cent of the GDP, much below the global average of 1.8 per cent.

Additionally, the industry-academia collaborations, skilling and research ecosystem continue to remain at a nascent stage, with more work to be done to strengthen it further.

Government’s educational endeavours
Since the NEP was implemented in 2020, the sector has witnessed a regulatory overdrive. In line with the outlined vision, the government has introduced policy initiatives to foster internationalisation through academic collaborations, such as dual/joint degrees, twinning programmes, and enabling foreign institutions to set up campuses in India.

Festive offer
To bring more strategic focus and transparency to the Indian education ecosystem, formalising the Institutional Development Plan (IDP), mandating public self-disclosure of information by higher education institutions (HEIs) on their websites, and formulating a student grievance redressal mechanism have bolstered efforts towards this cause. Enacting the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) Act, 2023, aims to improve the country’s research ecosystem.

Expectations from the impending budget
The lack of private capital for investment has often been a barrier for those wishing to establish educational institutions in India. Additionally, the regulatory and legal framework restricts foreign investments in trusts or societies (which is a regulatory pre-requisite), and this also makes foreign borrowings (External Commercial Borrowings or ECBs) an unattainable funding source for educational institutions in the country. Therefore, it is crucial to liberalise foreign investment and loan funding for educational institutions established as not-for-profit entities.

The Honourable Finance Minister announced in February 2020 that foreign investment and the ECB would be enabled for this sector, but four years later, it has yet to see the light of day.

Furthermore, the process and timelines for attracting donations from foreign sources continue to be long drawn and need to be urgently streamlined.

To facilitate new institutions, the government may consider establishing dedicated education zones with built-up infrastructure, either independently, through the private sector, or via public-private partnerships (PPP). These zones could act as plug-and-play lease-based models for institutions, thereby reducing their capex requirements. Also, common infrastructure facilities like student/ faculty housing, sports amenities, entertainment centres, research centres, etc., could be made available to multiple universities in such zones on a shared basis.

While reducing capital costs for institutions and students, these zones would offer opportunities for multicultural exchanges and cross-learning. To encourage private sector participation, the government could provide support and incentives in the form of subsidised land, tax rebates, or GST exemptions.","The Indian education sector faces significant opportunities and challenges as outlined in the National Education Policy (NEP), approaching its fourth year. Budgetary allocations have increased for infrastructure and quality enhancement, yet Research and Development (R&D) funding remains low at 0.7% of GDP. Government initiatives include fostering international collaborations and improving regulatory transparency. However, barriers like restrictive foreign investment rules hinder sector growth. Recommendations include liberalizing foreign investment, streamlining donation processes, and establishing dedicated education zones to reduce capital costs and encourage private sector involvement.",Education,84,511

the orissa times ,2024-09-10 00:00:00,MV Blackrose sinking still a mystery even after 15 yrs,"Paradip: Though the sinking of MV Blackrose completed 15 years Monday, the event and circumstances leading to the mysterious grounding of the foreign cargo ship in the anchorage area of Paradip port still remain unsolved. And in the absence of any clarity by investigating agencies, the mishap – in which a foreign sailor had died – continues to make waves in the state politics. On September 9, 2009, the China-bound ship ran aground about 6km away from the anchorage area of the Paradip port. The ship remained half-sunk and was visible till 2014.

However, it later went completely underwater. The ship’s mysterious sinking became an issue during successive Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in the state, with various political parties and outfits demanding a thorough probe into the incident. However, even 15 years later, the Odisha Police Crime Branch, which took over the investigation from the local police, has neither completed the probe nor has it been able to approach the owners of the ship, Se Cook, in Mongolia. According to reports, the incident occurred when iron ore was being loaded onto the ship which had anchored at the berth of Paradip port September 9, 2009. The vessel was loaded 23,847 metric tonnes of iron ore cargo when its Captain asked to stop further loading. This was because the iron ore was soaked in rainwater, and the heavy cargo made the barge of the ship tilt to one side. However, the port authorities directed the Captain to leave the port as it was a time-consuming exercise to dry up the wet iron ore. It was said that the wet ore could have been dried up on the anchorage area if the port authorities desired so. Significantly, no paperwork was carried out before directing the ship to leave the berth. After the ship moved from its berth, it gradually tilted to one side in the anchorage area, before finally sinking by evening.
On being informed, personnel from the Marine Department of Paradip port sent a tug boat which rescued 26, out of 27, sailors of the ship. However, the ship’s chief engineer, Oleksandr Liyushckenko, got trapped in the cabin and his body was recovered eight days after the mishap. Ten days after the ship ran aground, 4,200 kilolitre of fuel and 920 metric tonnes of furnace oil leaked from the vessel were found floating on the surface of seawater. Alarmed over the pollution, the port authorities called in a US-based agency to pump out the remaining fuel from the ship. The port authorities had spent over Rs 40 crore to accomplish the task. The Marine police station at Nehru Bungalow registered a case in this connection and, later, the state Crime Branch took over the probe.

In the subsequent period, two petitions were filed in this connection in the Orissa High Court and Calcutta High Court. According to reports, during the Crime Branch probe, it was found that the ship was sailing without a sea-worthiness certificate and was declared unfit for operation after remaining 25- years in sea.

The Mercantile Marine Department (MMD) was supposed to conduct a verification of the ship before allowing it for further operations. Questions were also raised as to how the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) allowed the ship to sail from country to country without proper documents for a prolonged period of five years.

Moreover, fingers were also raised at the Paradip port authorities who allowed the ship, to enter into the berth, which had spent over 25 years in sea and lacked fitness and proper documents. The agent of the shipping company was then blacklisted, but it is now back in operation at the port under a different name. Sources said that the iron ore loaded in this ship belonged to three export agencies, and it was headed for China. It is alleged that those export agencies had connections with some politicians of Odisha. The Paradip Port authorities recommended a CBI probe into the incident in 2018, but nothing has happened so far. Moreover, the Centre has yet to summon the owners of the ship, Se Cook, to the country for questioning. Besides, the sunken ship is yet to be retrieved from the sea despite it posing an imminent threat to other ships sailing in the route travelling in the sea. Many fishing boats had close shaves after hitting the sunken ship.

Meanwhile, when contacted, Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), Santosh Jena, said,” The matter is sub-judice. Anyways, the Crime Branch is investigating the case. I am not authorised to speak on the matter.”","The sinking of the MV Blackrose, which occurred 15 years ago in Paradip Port, remains unsolved, with no clear answers from investigating agencies. The foreign cargo ship ran aground on September 9, 2009, while loading iron ore at Paradip. After being directed to leave the berth, the ship tilted and eventually sank. The incident led to pollution due to fuel leakage, and despite investigations by the Odisha Police Crime Branch, the owners of the ship, Se Cook, in Mongolia have not been approached. Legal petitions and political pressure have called for a thorough investigation, but no substantial progress has been made. Additionally, the sunken ship remains a hazard for maritime safety.",Crime and Justice,111,759
The Pioneer ,2024-07-13 00:00:00,A call for civility and integrity in democracy,"The Constitution and its makers Deserve Respect in a functional democracy, election times could indeed become a celebration time, not only the competing candidates and their partiers, but also for the for entire country, which may involve votes, and future voters.  Imagine a situation in which every candidate remains respectful to all others, and is ever conscious of his words and their usage in every interaction, interview and interpretation of the views of his competitors.  Everyone who enters the election fray is duty-bound to remember that there is a generation of younger people watching closely how they conduct themselves in competitive conditions, and the extent to which they are conscious of their conduct and behaviour, both in public and private. Though it is a major responsibility of the family and school to shape the growing up of the children, the significance of the role of society and particularly those keen to lead the society could never be ignored. 

It is not only the ‘Acharya’ whose conduct is under watch and is emulated, children in their sensitive years learn from numerous sources, and no one is out of their ambit of keen observation. Having seen, observed and participated in the elections that were just over, one may find all these ‘expectations’ just ‘utopian, to be aspired for, but with full understanding that these would never be fulfilled!  After the election results, the parliament meets, and there is only a superficial bonhomie of a few minutes, followed by the same old routine of distrust, and a sense of shyness, the creation of hurdles and ensuring that the nation must once again get ready to suffer continuous shouting in both the Houses of parliament and regular walk-outs!

Is it amazing – and sadly enough, amusing – that the elected representatives of the great Indian democracy just cannot sit together and find out ways and means to sit together, express themselves, and arrive at inferences that are for the good of their voters?   How could they ignore that they are the legatee of Gandhi, Ambedkar, Rajendra Prasad, Rajagolachari, and that illustrious lot that prepared the Constitution, and had created conditions to enable them to get elected, enjoy all the perks and privileges that have been acquiring bulging proportions?  A veteran of the freedom struggle once told me he finds it repulsive when people go to Raj Ghat before beginning their so-called fasts, political dramas and whatever you may call it.  I share his anguish. Many others would also be doing so.  Those who indulge in such frivolities could remember what Dr Ambedkar had mentioned in his concluding speech in the Constituent Assembly on November 25, 1949: “If we wish to maintain democracy not merely in form, but also a fact, what must we do? The first thing in my judgment we must do is hold fast to constitutional methods of achieving our social and economic objectives. It means we must abandon the bloody methods of revolution. It means that we must abandon the method of civil disobedience, non-cooperation and satyagraha.” He goes on to point out that even with the Constitution in place, the nation, its people in general and those occupying constitutional positions in particular must never forget: “…however good a constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot.… The Constitution can provide only the organs of the State such as the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary.","The article emphasizes the need for respect towards the Constitution and its framers within a functional democracy. It envisions a political environment where candidates are respectful and conscious of their conduct, especially in the presence of younger generations observing their behavior. The piece criticizes the lack of genuine cooperation and respect in Parliament, noting the contrast between the ideals of figures like Gandhi and Ambedkar and the current state of political discord. It highlights Dr. Ambedkar’s belief that the success of democracy depends on the character of its leaders, not just the Constitution itself.",Opinion and Editorial,94,608

The Hindu,2024-08-29 00:00:00,Google Pixel 9 Review | Undoubtedly one of the best compact options available today,"
Google has unveiled its 9th series of Pixel phones. The new Pixel 9 succeeds over the Pixel 8, but on a personal note, it is the first Pixel phone after the Pixel 3 that has impressed me right from the moment, I took it out of the box. The new Google Pixel 9 comes with a fresh design and looks, upgraded chipset, camera, software, and lots of generative AI features. Priced at ₹79,999, it will be interesting to see how the phone holds out in the compact flagship race.

Design
The Google Pixel 9 sports a fresh, all-flat design that sets it apart from its predecessor. It now features a slightly larger size, still, the feel is compact like the S24, but the new pixels weigh a bit heavy. The phone features two Gorilla Glass Victus 2 panels and a flat aluminium frame, enhancing both durability and style. At the back of the phone, you will see the new oval camera bar - a bold change from the previous design seen in the Pixel 8, with a thick metal frame and a glass section housing two cameras and sensors.Despite its glossy finish, which can show fingerprints quickly, the Pixel 9 offers improved grip due to its flat shape and matte aluminium frame, which is something I liked compared to its predecessor. The phone’s front is dominated by a nearly bezel-less screen with a small punch-hole for the selfie camera and an ultra-thin slit above it for the earpiece that also doubles as a speaker. The new ultrasonic fingerprint scanner under the display is quick and reliable, adding to the overall polished feel of the Pixel 9. Located at the bottom are the SIM tray, USB port, and a second speaker, rounding out a thoughtfully designed device that balances aesthetics with functionality.Google Pixel 9 features a 6.3-inch Actua OLED display. With a resolution of 1080 x 2424 pixels and a pixel density of 422 ppi, it provides sharp and vibrant visuals. The display supports a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate, although it only switches between 120 Hz and 60 Hz, unlike the Pro’s more flexible LTPO panels. It offers up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness and HDR support, enhancing visibility and colour accuracy, making it ideal for HDR10 and HDR10+ content.The screen covers a full 24-bit depth, displaying up to 16 million colours, and features Widevine L1 certification for high-resolution streaming on platforms like YouTube and Netflix. While it lacks Dolby Digital compliance and 10-bit colour depth, it still provides a rich viewing experience with Google’s Ultra HDR standard for boosted brightness incompatible images.
Processor
The Pixel 9 is powered by Google’s latest chipset, the Tensor G4, which introduces several upgrades over its predecessor. The new processor has eight cores—one fewer than the G3—but each core has been upgraded to the latest generation. It features a combination of 1x3.1 GHz Cortex-X4, 3x2.6 GHz Cortex-A720, and 4x1.92 GHz Cortex-A520 cores, offering a balanced mix of high performance and efficiency. While the Mali-G715 MC7 stays as the GPU of choice, it now operates at a higher clock speed of 940Hz, compared to 890Hz on the Tensor G3, providing a slight boost in graphics performance. The phone also includes a Titan M2 security coprocessor for enhanced security and a third-generation TPU for AI tasks, although this hasn’t changed from the G3.

In terms of memory, the Google Pixel 9 comes with 12 GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 256 GB of storage, offering plenty of room for multitasking and storing apps, photos, and videos. The new energy-efficient Exynos 5400 modem by Samsung supports satellite connectivity, adding another layer of future-proofing. Thanks to the hardware improvements, the Pixel 9 delivers a fluid experience across various tasks. Navigating through the interface feels smooth, almost like gliding on water, and multitasking is handled with ease. Gaming is another area where the Pixel 9 shines; titles like BGMI and Asphalt run at high frame rates, providing a top-notch gaming experience. However, it’s worth noting that the device can get slightly warm during extended gaming sessions.

In benchmark tests, the Pixel 9 delivers respectable performance. It scored 1,769 in single-core and 4,096 in multi-core benchmarks on Geekbench, which is solid. While it may not be the fastest phone on the market in terms of raw numbers, the Pixel 9 still offers a balanced experience that combines adequate power with excellent software integration, making it a strong contender for users looking for a smooth and reliable smartphone experience.

Camera
Among Android phones, the Pixel has always been a catch, and the new Google Pixel 9 is no exception. The phone comes with the camera prowess of delivering exceptional images both at night and day.

The Google Pixel 9 offers a refined camera experience with a versatile dual rear camera system that delivers high-quality performance in various scenarios. It includes a 50 MP wide camera and a 48 MP ultrawide camera, both of which bring unique strengths to the table. The 50 MP wide camera features an Octa PD sensor with an ƒ/1.68 aperture, capturing sharp, detailed photos with its large 1/1.31 image sensor. This main camera provides a broad 82° field of view and supports Super Res Zoom up to 8x, allowing users to zoom in on distant subjects without significant loss of detail while maintaining optical quality at 0.5x, 1x, and 2x. Optical and electronic image stabilisation help keep shots steady, even in low-light conditions.

","The Google Pixel 9 has been unveiled with a sleek design and a suite of upgrades. It features a 6.3-inch Actua OLED display with a 120 Hz refresh rate and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness. Powered by the Tensor G4 chipset, the Pixel 9 offers enhanced performance with its eight-core setup and improved Mali-G715 MC7 GPU.

the hindu,2025-01-01 00:00:00,"Govt. mulling honorary senior ranks for retiring paramilitary personnel if not promoted on time, says former Director General of CRPF","Amid delays in promotion, the government is mulling honorary senior ranks for eligible Central Armed Police Force (CAPF) personnel a month before they retire in order to “boost their morale”, according to Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Director General Anish Dayal Singh who retired on December 31.


Mr. Singh, in conversation with CRPF officers on the last day in office on Tuesday (December 31, 2024), said that jawans and officers who benefit from Modified Assured Career Progression (MACP) but have not been granted promotion in rank due to constraints of the organising principle of the security force may use the insignia for the next senior rank on their uniforms a month before they retire. He said that if a person was retiring on a Constable’s rank and was eligible to be promoted as Head Constable (HC), he or she may use the HC’s rank. Similarly, if an HC is eligible to be promoted as Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI), he or she may use the insignia for ASI.


“For retiring personnel, to display the senior rank on his uniform to his family members and people in his village, it will be a morale boosting step. Home Minister (Amit Shah) has agreed to the proposal and I was hoping that the orders will come in a day or two but I think there will be a slight delay. It may require a little more deliberation but the proposal will be finalised soon for all the Central Armed Police Forces,” Mr. Singh said.

CAPF personnel are entitled to at least three promotions during service. In the absence of promotion, the MACP ensures financial benefits of the next senior rank on completion of 10, 20 and 30 years of service. According to the proposal, the promotion or the senior rank will reflect in the service records and personnel will be given the pay eligible, a senior CRPF official said.

“If a Constable has completed ten years in service and is eligible to be promoted as Head Constable (HC) upon fulfilling other criteria, and is still not promoted to the next rank due to the lack of vacancies, he or she may be given the financial benefit and the honorary rank if he is due for retirement. This was a demand from many jawans,” said the CRPF official. The official added that a piping ceremony will be held to grant the next rank and the discharge certificate on retirement will also bear the details of the promotion.

Ranbir Singh, who is retired from the CRPF and takes up efforts for the welfare of paramilitary personnel, said that despite a large number of vacancies, promotions in the CAPFs were getting delayed due to a lack of recruitment.

“Why cannot they promote CAPF personnel on time? There are several vacancies but posts are not being filled. A piping ceremony is held to accord the next rank. All this would boost their morale and motivate the jawans to work. The jawans stay away from their homes for many days, adding to their stress. Timely promotion can at least give them a purpose to perform their duties better,” said Mr. Singh.

According to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs’ (MHA) reply in the Rajya Sabha earlier this month, as on October 30, there were 1,00,204 vacant posts across all the CAPFs — the CRPF, the Border Security Force (BSF), the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) and the Assam Rifles. From 2020-2024, 71,231 posts were created across CAPFs. There are around 10 lakh CAPF personnel.

Mr. Singh said that the announcement by the retired CRPF DG was meant to bring cheer to the security personnel but under present circumstances it takes at least 20 years for a Constable to be promoted as Head Constable.","To address promotion delays in the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs), the government is considering granting honorary senior ranks to eligible personnel a month before retirement to boost morale. Retiring personnel who qualified for promotion but were not promoted due to organizational constraints may wear the insignia of the next rank and receive corresponding pay benefits. The proposal, supported by Home Minister Amit Shah, will cover all CAPFs. A piping ceremony and updated service records will reflect the honorary promotion. With over 1 lakh vacancies across CAPFs, delays remain a concern. The initiative aims to acknowledge service and motivate personnel.

Three students died in the basement of the popular IAS coaching institute yesterday, police said. Yuvraj, a UPSC aspirant, criticised both the MCD and the coaching institute for negligence, stating, ""MCD is responsible... they did not ensure safety measures. Both MCD and RAU's IAS are at fault, they should be held jointly liable. We have been protesting since last night but no higher authority has spoken to us yet. We expect that the death toll may be higher,"" Yuvraj told ANI.Another UPSC aspirant, Ankit Bhadana, expressed concern about trapped students, saying, ""Approximately 20-25 students are trapped inside the old Old Rajender Nagar coaching institute where the incident took place and their whereabouts are still unknown... No official from RAU's IAS has come forward to give any official statement yet. The government also has not yet spoken to any of the students,"" Ankit Bhadana told ANI.

Addressing safety concerns, another UPSC aspirant stated, ""Our demand is that action should be taken against those responsible for this negligence. All these operations in the basement are illegal and lack safety measures. Action should be taken.""

Another UPSC aspirant, Aman Shukla emphasized that the 'illegal' operation of libraries in basements should be stopped.""We demand that firstly, all these illegally operating libraries in basements be shut down.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-01 00:00:00,Putin tells Russians at New Year that ‘everything will be fine’,"President Vladimir Putin told Russians in a New Year address that the country would move forward with confidence in 2025, though he offered no specific promises on the economy or the war in Ukraine.

At a time when many ordinary people are worried about rising prices and the central bank’s 21% interest rate is squeezing businesses and homebuyers, Putin reassured Russians that their wellbeing was his top priority.

He framed Russia’s challenges as part of a wider historic mission, evoking past victories including its role in the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two.

Russia, he said, had overcome trials, achieved major goals and strengthened its unity in the first quarter of the 21st century – a period coinciding exactly with his time as its paramount leader.

“And now, on the threshold of the new year, we are thinking about the future. We are confident that everything will be fine, we will only move forward. We know for sure that the absolute value for us was, is and will be the fate of Russia, the well-being of its citizens,” he said.

His three-and-a-half-minute seasonal message from the Kremlin was being broadcast at midnight in each of Russia’s 11 time zones, starting with Kamchatka and Chukotka in the far east.

He was speaking exactly 25 years since he first addressed the nation as its acting president after Boris Yeltsin resigned unexpectedly on the last day of 1999.Putin, 72, paid tribute to Russian soldiers fighting in the war in Ukraine, describing them as heroes. “We are proud of your courage and bravery. We believe in you,” he said.

He made no specific reference to the situation on the battlefield or the prospects for an end to the conflict after Donald Trump returns as US president on Jan. 20. Trump has said he will swiftly stop the war, without providing details.

LOSSES IN UKRAINE
Russian forces in 2024 advanced in Ukraine at the fastest rate since 2022, the war’s first year, and control about a fifth of the country. But the gains have come at the cost of heavy, though undisclosed, losses in men and equipment.

In 2024, Russia was invaded for the first time since World War Two as Ukraine grabbed a slice of its western Kursk region in a surprise counter-attack on Aug. 6.Russia has yet to eject Ukrainian forces from Kursk despite bringing in more than 10,000 troops from its ally North Korea, according to Ukrainian, South Korean and US assessments. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence.

“To sustain even the very slow advance in Ukraine, Russia has been forced to ignore the months-long occupation of part of its own territory by Ukrainian forces,” British security expert Ruth Deyermond said.

“Taking a ‘nothing to see here’ attitude to the loss of its own land is not what great powers do, particularly one so preoccupied with the idea of state sovereignty.”

Deyermond, in a long thread posted on X, suggested Putin’s efforts to portray Russia as a leading world power were also undermined by the toppling of its chief Middle East ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and its increasing dependence on China.","In his New Year address, President Putin reassured Russians about the country's future, prioritizing citizens' wellbeing despite challenges like rising prices and high interest rates. He framed Russia’s struggles as part of a historic mission, recalling past victories, and expressed confidence in moving forward in 2025.

While praising soldiers fighting in Ukraine, he avoided specifics on the war's progress or peace prospects with US President Trump set to return in January. Russia made gains in Ukraine but suffered significant losses. Ukraine also launched a successful counterattack, seizing part of Russia's Kursk region, complicating Putin’s narrative of strength.",International News,97,525

While the first conviction was in 2019, the latest of the six was obtained by a special PMLA Chennai court in September 2024. A few more related cases are still at the trial stage.

The probe is significant for multiple reasons; firstly, ED got the convictions even before investigation of the predicate offences of forgery, impersonation and cheating were completed by the Greater Chennai Police and CBI. Secondly, one of those convicted by the PMLA court was not even an accused in the predicate offence booked by Chennai police.

During trial, ED not only proved money laundering, but produced evidence to also establish the charges of forgery, impersonation and cheating. These points passed the judicial test even in the Madras High Court, establishing PMLA as a standalone offence.

This led to the cases emerging as a case study across India and in meetings of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), sources said.

The investigation began in 2016 when it was found that multiple shell companies in Chennai used fake bills of entries to show import of electronics to Chennai. Laundering was then done by making payments in US dollars to Hong Kong-based entities for these fake imports that never happened.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has secured six of its 42 all-India Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) convictions in a money-laundering case involving Rs 120 crore worth of US dollars sent to Hong Kong through shady accounts at two Chennai banks.

In his address on Kargil Vijay Diwas here to mark the 25th anniversary of victory in Kargil war, Modi said some people were playing politics over a sensitive issue related to national security and rubbished claims that the Agnipath scheme was launched to save pension money.

""The aim of Agnipath is to make the forces young...The aim of Agnipath is to keep the armies continuously fit for war,"" he said.

""Unfortunately, such a sensitive issue related to national security has been made a subject of politics by some people. Some people are playing politics of lies for their personal interests even on this reform of the army,"" he said.

The prime minister said Angipath scheme is an example of necessary reforms done by the army.

""For decades, there have been discussions in Parliament and various committees on making the armed forces younger. The average age of Indian soldiers being higher than the global average has been a matter of concern,"" he added.

He said this issue was raised in many committees for years but the will to resolve this national security challenge was not shown earlier.

""The country has addressed this concern through the Agnipath scheme,"" he said.

Hitting out at the opposition, Modi said, ""These are the same people who weakened our forces by committing scams worth thousands of crores in the forces.""

He said these people did not want the Indian Air Force to get modern fighter jets and they had ""made preparations to lock the Tejas fighter plane in a box.""

The prime minister also rubbished the claims that Agnipath scheme was launched to save pension money.

""Some people are also spreading the misconception that the government has come up with this scheme to save pension money. I want to ask such people, the question of pension for today's recruits will arise after 30 years.Why would the government take a decision today,"" he asked.

Modi said his government has respected the decision taken by the forces as ""for us the security of the country is paramount, not politics"".

""Those who are misleading the youth of the country...history is witness to the fact that they do not care about the soldiers.

The New Indian Express,2024-09-08 00:00:00,Here's to achieving everyday bliss,"In the relentless pursuit of grand achievements, we often find ourselves overlooking the small, everyday moments that truly make life meaningful.

We’re conditioned to believe that happiness lies in reaching significant milestones—be it career success, acquiring material wealth or achieving societal status. However, in this race to attain the big things, we lose sight of the profound joy that comes from appreciating the little things. Life is not just about the peaks; it’s about savouring the journey, embracing the simple pleasures and nurturing the moments that keep us grounded. By focusing on these tiny details—like a kind gesture, a quiet moment of reflection or the warmth of a loved one’s smile—we stay connected to our roots, grow as individuals, and experience a deeper, more enduring sense of happiness.

 Happiness is a Practice

Happiness is not a fleeting state of mind that we experience only during moments of triumph. It is a way of life that we cultivate daily.

Life is full of ups and downs, and it’s inevitable that we will face challenges, disappointments and setbacks. However, the true essence of living lies in how we choose to respond to these adversities. The real ‘taste of life’ comes from maintaining our joy and inner peace, even when circumstances are tough. By consciously practicing happiness, we learn to find light in the darkest moments, transforming challenges into opportunities for growth.

The Arunachal Front,2024-09-09 00:00:00,Typhoon Yagi kills 14 in Vietnam as officials warn of heavy rain that can cause flooding,"At least 14 people have died and 176 others injured in Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi slammed the country’s north, state media said Sunday, as officials warned of heavy downpours despite its waning power.

Described by Vietnamese officials as one of the most powerful typhoons to hit the region over the last decade, Yagi left more than 3 million people without electricity in northern Vietnam. It also damaged vital agricultural land, nearly 116,192 hectares where rice and fruits are mostly grown. Hundreds of flights were canceled after four airports were closed.

The typhoon made landfall in Vietnam’s northern coastal provinces of Quang Ninh and Haiphong with wind speeds of up to 149 kilometers per hour (92 miles per hour) on Saturday afternoon. It raged for roughly 15 hours before gradually weakening into a tropical depression early Sunday morning. Vietnam’s meteorological department predicted heavy rain in northern and central provinces and warned of floods in low-lying areas, flash floods in streams and landslides on steep slopes.

Municipal workers along with army and police forces were busy in the capital, Hanoi, clearing uprooted trees, fallen billboards, toppled electricity poles and rooftops that were swept away, while assessing damaged buildings.

Yagi was still a storm when it blew out of the northwestern Philippines into the South China Sea on Wednesday, leaving at least 20 people dead and 26 others missing mostly in landslides and widespread flooding in the acrchipelago nation. It then made its way to China, killing three people and injuring nearly a hundred others, before landing in Vietnam.

Storms like Typhoon Yagi were “getting stronger due to climate change, primarily because warmer ocean waters provide more energy to fuel the storms, leading to increased wind speeds and heavier rainfall,” said Benjamin Horton, director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore.","At least 14 people were killed and 176 injured in northern Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi struck with wind speeds reaching 149 km/h.

Hundreds of flights were canceled as four airports shut down. After making landfall in Quang Ninh and Haiphong on Saturday, Yagi raged for about 15 hours before weakening into a tropical depression by Sunday.

Authorities warned of ongoing risks, including heavy rain, flooding, landslides, and flash floods, especially in low-lying and mountainous regions. Cleanup efforts were underway in Hanoi, involving municipal workers, police, and the army.

Before hitting Vietnam, Yagi had caused significant destruction across Southeast Asia. It killed 20 and left 26 missing in the Philippines, mostly due to flooding and landslides, and caused three deaths and nearly 100 injuries in China.

The Sikkim Express,2024-09-29 00:00:00,Nature Conservancy,"Life in Outer Space
Is there any scientific basis regarding the sitings of UFO, aliens and life in outer planet ? 

The scientific basis for UFO sightings, aliens, and life on other planets is a mix of ongoing research, theoretical speculation, and investigation of reported phenomena. Here’s a breakdown of these concepts:

1. UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects):

Definition: UFOs are any airborne objects or phenomena that cannot be immediately identified by the observer. While some UFOs are later explained as aircraft, weather phenomena, or other known objects, some remain unexplained.

Scientific Inquiry: Organizations like the U.S. Department of Defense have investigated UFO reports through programs like the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). In 2021, the U.S. government released a report acknowledging that some UFO sightings could not be explained.

Possible Explanations: Scientific explanations for UFOs include misidentified natural phenomena (e.g., lightning, meteors), human-made objects (e.g., drones, military aircraft), or atmospheric conditions.

2. Aliens (Extraterrestrial Life):

Scientific Search: The search for extraterrestrial life is a major area of scientific research. Projects like the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) use radio telescopes to listen for signals from intelligent civilizations.

Astrobiology: Astrobiology is the study of life in the universe. Researchers investigate extreme environments on Earth (e.g., deep-sea vents, acidic lakes) to understand how life might exist on other planets or moons.

Potential Habitats: Some of the most promising locations for life include Mars, Europa (a moon of Jupiter), and Enceladus (a moon of Saturn). These bodies have evidence of water, a key ingredient for life.

3. Life on Other Planets:

Exoplanets: Thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) have been discovered. Some are in the ""habitable zone,"" where conditions might support liquid water and, potentially, life.

Biosignatures: Scientists are searching for biosignatures—chemical signs of life—in the atmospheres of exoplanets. This includes gases like oxygen or methane, which could indicate biological activity.

Mars Exploration: Mars rovers, such as Curiosity and Perseverance, are searching for signs of past or present life on Mars, including organic molecules and microbial life.

4. Current Consensus:

No Confirmed Evidence of Aliens: Despite decades of research and exploration, there is no confirmed evidence of alien life. However, the discovery of extremophiles on Earth (organisms that live in extreme conditions) suggests that life could potentially exist in diverse environments.

Scientific Approach: The scientific community remains open to the possibility of extraterrestrial life but emphasizes the need for rigorous evidence. Any claim of alien life or UFOs requires careful scrutiny and confirmation.

In summary, while UFO sightings often have mundane explanations, the search for extraterrestrial life is a serious and active area of scientific research. There is no confirmed evidence of aliens, but the discovery of life elsewhere in the universe remains a tantalizing possibility.

Has there been ever any scientific documentation about life in other planets ? 

While there hasn't been any confirmed scientific documentation of life on other planets, there have been significant efforts to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. Here are some key points in the search for life beyond Earth:

Mars Exploration: Mars is one of the most studied planets in the search for life. NASA's rovers, like Curiosity and Perseverance, have been exploring the Martian surface to search for signs of past life. While no direct evidence of life has been found, organic molecules and evidence of ancient water have been discovered, which are promising signs.
Europa and Enceladus: These moons of Jupiter and Saturn, respectively, are considered potential candidates for hosting life. Both moons have subsurface oceans beneath their icy crusts. The presence of water, along with the detection of chemical compounds that could support life, makes them prime targets for future missions.

Exoplanets: Thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system) have been discovered, some of which lie in the ""habitable zone"" of their stars, where conditions might allow for liquid water. Instruments like the Kepler Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope are helping in the search for potentially habitable exoplanets.

Biosignatures and Technosignatures: Scientists are also searching for biosignatures (chemical indicators of life) and technosignatures (signals or artifacts indicating advanced civilizations). Projects like SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) have been scanning the skies for radio signals that could indicate the presence of intelligent life.

While the search continues, no scientific documentation has yet confirmed the existence of life on other planets. However, the discoveries made so far suggest that the conditions for life might exist elsewhere in the universe.

Is there any scientific  possibility that there is life in the universe outside the planet Earth? 

Yes, there is a significant scientific possibility that life exists elsewhere in the universe. Here are some key points that support this possibility:

Vastness of the Universe: The universe is incredibly vast, with billions of galaxies, each containing billions of stars and potentially even more planets. The sheer number of planetary systems increases the likelihood that some of them might harbor life.

Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone: Astronomers have discovered thousands of exoplanets (planets outside our solar system), some of which are located in the ""habitable zone"" of their stars. This is the region where conditions might be just right for liquid water to exist, which is essential for life as we know it.

Extremophiles on Earth: Life on Earth exists in some of the most extreme environments, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, acidic hot springs, and polar ice caps. The existence of these extremophiles suggests that life could potentially thrive in a wide range of conditions, possibly even on other planets or moons with harsh environments.

Organic Molecules in Space: Organic molecules, which are the building blocks of life, have been found on comets, asteroids, and in interstellar space. This suggests that the basic ingredients for life are widespread in the universe.

Mars and Icy Moons: Mars, with its past presence of liquid water, and moons like Europa (orbiting Jupiter) and Enceladus (orbiting Saturn), which have subsurface oceans, are considered prime candidates within our solar system for hosting microbial life.

The Drake Equation: The Drake Equation is a probabilistic formula used to estimate the number of civilizations in our galaxy with which we might be able to communicate. While the equation has many uncertainties, it underscores the possibility of life elsewhere.

While no definitive evidence of extraterrestrial life has been found yet, ongoing missions and research continue to explore this exciting possibility. The discovery of even microbial life beyond Earth would have profound implications for our understanding of biology, the origins of life, and our place in the universe.","The article discusses the scientific exploration of UFO sightings and the search for extraterrestrial life. UFOs are identified as unidentified aerial phenomena, with many being later explained as natural or human-made objects. Although no confirmed evidence of extraterrestrial life exists, the search continues through initiatives like SETI and ongoing Mars missions. Mars, along with moons like Europa and Enceladus, is considered a promising location for potential life due to evidence of water. Additionally, scientists are investigating exoplanets located in habitable zones around stars, where conditions may support life. The presence of extremophiles on Earth—organisms thriving in extreme environments—suggests that life could exist in diverse conditions across the universe.

He was arrested on Sunday night for allegedly molesting a woman at a citizens' protest march on Sunday. Prima facie, cops suspect that he might have been paid to create trouble.

Paul had a busy Sunday responding to pest control calls before he returned home and asked his mother for an early dinner at 8 pm. He then reportedly left home without informing her where he was heading to. His father Bijon Paul, a CPM loyalist, refused to speak much about the arrest citing restrictions from lawyers and cops but accepted that his son had not returned at night. It was between 7 am and 7.30 am that they got a call from Hare Street police, stating that they needed to come down as their son had been put under arrest, said Bijon. The father insisted he had only heard claims that his son was ""drunk"" on Sunday night but claimed he saw no such signs in the evening.

The parents insist that their son was a victim of ""circumstances"" but said they were not aware if their son had attended other protests before. ""He never shared his political beliefs with us. Do not bother us as we have been asked not to speak by our lawyers,"" said Paul's mother.
Police though brought a strong charge against the accused, stating he had touched a protesting woman inappropriately with a plan. ""Primary investigations show that he might have been paid to create trouble in the protest. There were others who were present in the protest who worked along with him,"" claimed an investigator.
Police claimed that his interrogation was necessary to know who the mastermind was. ""We sought Paul's custody till Sept 11. Our prayer has been granted. He has been charged under BNS 74, which pertains to molestation,"" said the public prosecutor.

Indian Express,2024-12-24 00:00:00,"Sambhal raids stir troubled waters, officials say part of ongoing anti-power theft campaign in UP","Sambhal Samajwadi Party MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq, who is already facing charges over the November 24 violence in Sambhal, has been slapped with a fine of Rs 1.91 crore over alleged power theft and threatened with attachment of his property if the dues are not paid within 15 days. The electricity supply to his Sambhal residence has been disconnected, while his father Mamlukur Rehman Barq has also been booked, for allegedly threatening power officials during the inspection of their residence.

On Thursday, the Power Department initiated similar action across the Moradabad division, which includes the Sambhal district, with Commissioner Aunjaneya Kumar Singh ordering stringent checking for electricity theft across all religious places.

The orders were passed at a divisional review meeting attended by senior officials including district magistrates of Bijnor, Rampur, Amroha and Sambhal. Singh said officials should check electricity metres at temples, mosques, gurdwaras and churches in all the districts of the division.

As per senior UPPCL officials, while the action in Sambhal may have drawn attention, the drive against electricity theft in the state is routine and ongoing. What is different this time, they say, is that inspections are being conducted in areas reporting “significant electricity losses”.

According to them, among districts identified by them after a survey, where “targeted inspections” are on, include Budaun, Bareilly, Lakhimpur Kheri, Moradabad, and others. On Saturday, officials said, residents in Budaun and Rampur held a protest as the team arrived for inspections, and locals intervened to resolve the matter. “We have a WhatsApp group where officials share updates, including photographs, of protests occurring in their respective districts,” said an official at the Lucknow headquarters.

An officer said that over the past three months, new instructions have gone out on how and when inspections should be conducted. “We keep comprehensive records of consumption patterns to pinpoint areas in sub-stations where electricity usage is high, but revenue collection remains low,” said the officer.

While the state produces around 7,000 MW of power, even in winters, daily consumption can go up to 15,000 MW, the officer said. “It is estimated that around 20-22% of the total electricity supplied is lost due to theft and other reasons.”

As part of its drive, the Power Department is also replacing old electric meters with smart meters, and upgrading electricity wires to guard against damage and theft.

Earlier this week, UPPCL Chairman Dr Ashish Kumar Goel directed that efforts to curb electricity theft needed more push. The department recently announced a One-Time Settlement scheme to enhance bill collection.

In Sambhal, officials said, the campaign has been on for four months, and intensified over the past few days as it moved into densely populated areas with police deployed to ward off any trouble. Three drone cameras are being used to identify buildings and houses which may have unauthorised power connections.

“In the last four days, we have identified 196 locations where illegal power connections were being used, and cases have been registered. These include five mosques and a madrasa,” Vinod Kumar Gupta, Superintendent Engineer (Power), Sambhal, told The Indian Express.

SP Sambhal district president Asgar Ali said they had no problems with any checks against power theft, but that a routine procedure had been turned into “targeted raids at the behest of political leaders”. Ali pointed to action in four Muslim-dominated areas of Sambhal.

About the action against MP Barq, Ali said he belongs to a prominent political family, with his grandfather Shafiqur Rahman Barq, who passed away earlier this year, a long-serving MP. “Zia Ur Rehman was an MLA before becoming an MP. Does it make any sense to accuse someone of his stature of stealing electricity?” Ali said.

Gupta denied allegations of selective action, or of acting on a specific complaint, saying: “We have registered FIRs against a mosque and all the houses found using illegal electricity connections (in Sambhal).”

BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said: “The FIR against MP Zia Ur Rehman was filed after a preliminary inquiry, and it is concerning that those responsible for making laws are involved in such activities… The SP should take action against him instead of defending him.”","Samajwadi Party MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq has been fined ₹1.91 crore for alleged power theft in Sambhal, with his electricity disconnected and property threatened with attachment.

This needs to be investigated by media and investigating agencies, including analysis of the settled and compounded cases and the consultation fees paid by such corporates and received by the Sebi chairperson and her connected persons. These are many ways she and her husband extort money from corporates and stock market corrupt operators and fund managers,” he alleged.
Sources said the Sebi investigation against Chandra has revealed that the fund diversion from Zee is multi-fold than what was earlier estimated. The regulator is in the process of issuing fresh show cause notices to Chandra and his son Puneet Goenka in the matter, they said.
Chandra also alleged former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar was giving Buch “heft sums of money” and they made at least 20 calls to each other every day. 
""It was Kochhar and her husband, and Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband working in tandem. Hence, Madhabi Puri Buch was paid hefty sums of money by ICICI while she was the WTM at Sebi,"" Chandra said.

In an order in August 2023, Sebi had barred Chandra and his son Punit Goenka from holding key positions in four group firms. In June 2023, Sebi had alleged fraudulent practices and fund diversion by promoters from Shirpur Gold Refinery, an Essel Group firm.
The uncertainty created by Sebi’s action against the founders scuttled the $10 billion merger between Zee and Japan’s Sony’s India unit.

“The Zee-Sony merger was progressing well and it had got stock exchange approval. Despite the same, Sebi instructed BSE/NSE to intervene in NCLT proceedings and scuttle the merger by spooking Sony. Ultimately the merger was terminated by Sony which resulted in erosion of huge wealth of minority shareholders,” Chandra said.

He also objected to Sebi's move to penalise two mutual fund houses which had invested money in the group.
","Subhash Chandra, chairman emeritus of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, has criticized Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch, alleging corruption and manipulation. Chandra claimed Buch, who is under scrutiny by SEBI for alleged fund diversion exceeding ₹2,000 crore from Zee, has seen her and her husband's income rise significantly since her appointment. He accused her of extorting money from corporates and linked her to alleged financial misconduct involving former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar. SEBI, meanwhile, has intensified its investigation into Zee’s fund diversion and is preparing fresh notices for Chandra and his son. Chandra also alleged SEBI's actions derailed a $10 billion merger with Sony, impacting shareholder wealth. SEBI has labeled these accusations as ""malicious and opportunist,"" with Buch not yet responding to the allegations.",Business and Finance,129,464

The arunachal times ,2024-11-03 00:00:00,Ha Welfare Society refutes claim by ST Abhiyan Committee,"Ha Welfare Society on Saturday refuted the allegations made by the Arunachal Pradesh Non-APST Offspring ST Surrender Abhiyan Committee, which claimed that Ha Tatu is a non-APST.

Addressing reporters at the Arunachal Press Club here, the society clarified all the points of the allegations leveled against Tatu, chairman of the Ha Welfare Society, stating that he has a non-APST father.

The society noted that there has been confusion regarding Ha Tatu’s status as a bonafide member of the Arunachal Pradesh ST community. Members of the Ha Welfare Society expressed surprise at the allegations made by the Committee’s chairman Taw Paul earlier on Friday. The society requested evidence from the Non-APST Offspring Committee to substantiate their claim that

 Tatu has a non-APST father named T.C. Dutto, asserting that if such proof exists, they would publicly declare it.

The Ha Welfare Society clarified Tatu’s procurement of an ST certificate in 2017 in ICR, stating that he previously held an ST/PRC certificate from 1994, which needed to be updated because the term “Dafla” was used in the tribe certificate for the Nyishi community. They said that if Tatu uses his mother’s title, Lokam, there should be substantial evidence to support it. The society also mentioned that a complaint was filed by one Lokam Talo in the High Court, questioning Tatu’s APST status. The court directed an investigation into whether Tatu is a non-APST or APST, resulting in several hearings in the district court. The court requested evidence, which the complainant could not provide.

According to a letter from the ICR deputy commissioner, dated 6 May, 2023, the inquiry report from the Itanagar police station found no evidence proving that Tatu is a non-APST and confirmed his belonging to the Nyishi community of Arunachal Pradesh. The court dismissed the case, as there was no evidence against Ha Tatu’s APST status, stated the Ha Welfare Society.

The society also informed that Tatu obtained a new ST and PRC on December 4, 2023, as per the High Court’s direction.

The society said, “We are a law-abiding society, and we prioritize the law. Since Tatu’s issue was already in court, we have been adhering to legal processes.”","The Ha Welfare Society defended Ha Tatu against allegations from the Arunachal Pradesh Non-APST Offspring ST Surrender Abhiyan Committee, asserting his status as a bona fide member of the Arunachal ST community. The society highlighted that investigations found no evidence of Tatu being a non-APST, leading to a court dismissal of the complaint against him. Tatu has since received an updated ST certificate.

Hindustan Times,2024-10-10 00:00:00,From the Indica to the Nano: How Ratan Tata transformed the Indian automotive landscape,"Ratan Tata’s indelible mark across India’s industrial landscape is one that is normally formed after several lifetimes. Although Tata can be credited for transforming the Tata Group, it was arguably his singular vision for Tata Motors that marked the greatest evolutionary leap for India’s automotive industry, bringing-in a level of autonomy at a time when it was still heavily reliant on Japanese technology. Tata’s leadership led to some of Tata Motors’ most significant milestones, fighting overwhelming odds, and underscoring India’s economic might in the process.

Tata Indica: Indigenous and ingenious
Although Tata Motors, then known as Tata Engineering and Locomotive Co. Ltd. (TELCO) began its journey in 1954, producing commercial vehicles; it didn’t come of age until the arrival of the Indica in 1998. Sure, the Sierra and the Tata Estate were signifiers of both, a liberalized India and Tata’s intent as a serious carmaker. But the Indica was the first indigenous product built and designed keeping in mind India’s aspirations, needs and its challenging infrastructure. Tata wasn’t the only one to recognise the car as an engine of rapid economic growth. A truly localized Indian hatchback had been attempted in the past, most famously by Sanjay Gandhi, but it proved to be a far too great a challenge for pre-liberalization India.

All mass mobilisers of a nation are a product of their environment. The Citroen 2CV was designed to traverse a semi-agricultural French landscape, the Fiat 500 – Italy’s narrow, cobbled roads and so on. The Tata Indica was a product of Indian aspirations and needs in a manner even the 800 wasn’t. The Maruti 800 brought-in reliability and frugality to India’s then barren automotive landscape, the Indica brought in greater practicality, more space and with its Turin-born design, a level of desirability that the entry-level market had not seen thus far. Tata recognised the need for luggage space, as Indians were traditionally heavy packers prone to carrying large containers of home made food, as mentioned in Harish Bhat’s “Tata Indica: The Very First Indian Car”. Furthermore, the Indica did what no hatchback had done before: it brought the fuel efficiency of a diesel motor to the family hatch. Although it was primarily a sum of globally imported parts, it did bring in new manufacturing capabilities to the Tata Motors fold with a transmission system designed in-house. For the rest, Tata shopped around the globe. The first Indian car, whose initial sketches were provided by Tata himself, featured Italian design, but, according to Bhat’s book “3800 components, 700-plus dies and 4000 fixtures were designed back home in Pune”. The brand did have to rely on foreign expertise to be a guiding force, as it had no historic precedent for what was considered, within India, an over-ambitious undertaking that could make or break the company with a product that needed roughly ₹1700 crores in investments. Expertise for the engine came from France and production equipment from Nissan, which had closed its Australian manufacturing operation.

The Indica, upon launch, was far from a perfect car, with many teething issues. But it got the broad strokes right, which were later perfected by the Indica V2 - a more reliable, field-tested product that restored customer confidence. But the venture had paid off and the critics both Indian and international were silenced. The Indica was a success.

The Tata Nano : A giant among small cars
The Indica was Tata Motors’ first commercial success. The Nano was a streamlined version of that vision, aiming to bring mobility to those masses which could not afford the Indica. And Ratan Tata was something of a wunderkind when it came to streamlining operations.

According to a research paper on the Nano published by the University of Virginia, “Tata sought the bulk of its cost savings in a streamlined, modular design in which many components served more than one function. Perhaps most notably, the car’s components could be built at separate facilities and shipped for local manufacture

The Nano may not have served its intended purpose. Unlike the Indica which served to offer more for less, the Nano was seen as the lowest common denominator of cars.

Unlike mass mobilisers of the past which emerged at a time when automotive technology was novel and war-ravaged economies had lowered aspirations, the Nano had several precedents that were seen as superior. But it offered a glimpse into Ratan Tata’s entrepreneurial genius, and into the mind-boggling logistical tight-rope act it is to mass produce a truly ambitious low-cost car. Tata aimed to empower the country’s multitude of bush mechanics, who, in his words, would serve as “satellite assembly operations” for the brand. The Nano was not a mechanical failure as much as it was a marketing mishap, but before that it was an idea so powerful, it made waves even before its launch.

In the months preceding the car’s launch used car sales for the likes of the Maruti 800 fell by 30%. With the then (2007) second-largest two-wheeler market in the world, Tata sought to bring the safety and comfort, not to mention social legitimacy to India’s vast two-wheeler riding multitude with a car that cost only three times as much as an average two-wheeler. The Indian economy was booming and the Nano seemed primed to capture that sentiment. Unfortunately, the Nano’s unconventional shape, and it's all-too evident barebones structure was visibly indicative of cost-saving measures when it was launched in 2008. Unlike the Indica, the Nano Twist failed to salvage the Nano’s image, particularly at a time when Maruti Suzuki had counter-offensives in the form of the Alto. But the Nano was still a triumph – it was one of the world’s most fuel efficient cars, despite its diminutive footprint, it offered more interior room than the 800, was very easy to maneuver and drive inside tight spaces. Despite how it was positioned, it provided a level of comfort at a price point that was thus far unheard of.

Although Tata Motors has refuted all claims regarding the revival of the Nano brand, it begs to be baptized as a low-range, low-cost inner city EV.

Arriving on the global stage: The acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover
Back in 2009, in an episode of the hit BBC TV show Top Gear journalist and presenter Jeremy Clarkson said “A little company called Tata have just shown their new car. And here it is, the Jaguar XJ!” Ratan Tata oversaw what was arguably the most significant moment for any Indian corporate entity. Clarkson, known for his comically dismissive remarks, wasn’t very accurate. By the time it acquired JLR, Tata Motors was the sixth-largest commercial vehicle manufacturer in the world. In 2004, it was the first Indian manufacturing company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

The acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover boosted Indian nationalistic pride in a manner several cricket World Cup victories couldn’t. Tata hadn’t just purchased a British icon, it had purchased it from the Ford Motor Company that had infamously mocked Tata’s attempts at making an affordable car, refusing sale of Tata’s passenger car vertical by asking Tata why he entered the car business at all.

Jaguar Land Rover had traded hands several times before it was purchased from Ford. Given that its acquisition was followed, five years later by Tata’s own retirement, it was his swan song. The world took note of Tata Motors as a company of consequence. According to Ray Hutton, author of Jewels in the Crown: How Tata of India Transformed Britain’s Jaguar and Land Rover Tata reassured everyone that “The feel of Jaguar and Land Rover would not be tinkered in any way (…) Our challenge will be to nurture the brands and make them thrive”. The sale was completed on the 2nd of June 2008 for $2.3 billion. Jaguar went on to produce some of its most sensational sedans and sports cars under Tata’s ownership, as did Land Rover, morphing its iconic Range Rover from an emblem of old British money to a global luxury tour-de-force.

","
Ratan Tata's visionary leadership revolutionized India’s automotive industry through groundbreaking initiatives at Tata Motors. His legacy began with the Tata Indica in 1998—India's first fully indigenous passenger car, designed to meet local needs and aspirations. Despite initial flaws, the Indica became a commercial success, setting a new benchmark in Indian car manufacturing. Tata’s most ambitious project, the Tata Nano, aimed to provide affordable mobility to millions. Though it struggled in the market due to perception issues, it showcased Tata’s engineering innovation and social vision.

His crowning achievement, however, was the acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) from Ford in 2008. This bold move elevated Tata Motors to the global stage, turning around two struggling luxury brands into global powerhouses. JLR’s success under Tata’s stewardship reflected both national pride and the company’s rising global stature. Through these landmark ventures, Ratan Tata not only transformed Tata Motors but also reshaped India's industrial identity.

DNA,2024-07-19 00:00:00,"US President Biden 'soul searching' amid calls to step down, says he will quit Presidential race if...","US President Joe Biden is taking calls to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate seriously and multiple Democratic officials think an exit is a matter of time, according to sources familiar with the matter.

“His soul searching is actually happening, I know that for a fact,” said one of the sources, who requested anonymity. “He’s thinking about this very seriously.”

Biden, 81, has faced increasing pressure from heavyweights in his party to cede his position at the top of the ticket after a shoddy debate performance against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, raised fears about his age and ability to win in November.
The president has pushed back defiantly against those calls, arguing that he has won millions of votes in primary races over the last several months and is Democratic voters’ choice. As recently as Wednesday, he vowed “I am all in” the 2024 race.

Speaking to the media outlet BET, Biden said, ""If I had some medical condition that emerged if somebody if the doctors came and said 'you've got this problem, that problem.""

He further added, ""I said I was going to be a transitional candidate, and I thought I'd be able to move on from this, pass it on to someone else. But I didn't anticipate things getting so, so, so divided.""

Another of the sources, a Democratic congressional aide, said the writing appeared to be on the wall for the president after lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly urged him to drop out of the race.

“It feels like it’s a matter of … when, not if,” the aide said.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a close Biden ally, told CNN on Thursday that Biden will be “resting and reflecting” this weekend as he recovers from COVID-19.

He has been asking for information on polling data and weighs seriously the input of those he trusts and admires, Coons said, adding he thinks Biden is the best candidate to run in 2024.

Biden is convalescing at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. He had no public events on Thursday after concluding a trip to the political swing state of Nevada on Wednesday.

Biden’s campaign is focusing on three out of seven battleground states after the debate, a narrow path to victory, but it has rejected suggestions that he is ready to step aside.

“He is not wavering on anything. The president has made his decision,” deputy campaign manager Quentin Fulks said in Milwaukee, where the Republican convention is taking place. “Joe Biden has said he is running for president of the United States. Our campaign is moving forward.”

Democratic Senator John Hickenlooper of Colorado said he believed that Biden was working toward a decision on whether to stay in the presidential race and would opt for what is good for the country.

Former House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed Representative Adam Schiff’s call for Biden to step aside, a top White House source with direct knowledge of the matter said. But a source close to Pelosi – one of the most influential members of Biden’s Democratic Party – said that Schiff did not consult with Pelosi before making his concerns public.

","US President Joe Biden is reportedly taking seriously calls to step aside as the Democratic presidential candidate, with multiple Democratic officials believing an exit is imminent. Sources close to the matter say Biden is ""soul searching"" and considering his options after a poor debate performance raised concerns about his age and ability to win in November. Despite pushing back against calls to drop out, Biden has hinted that he would consider stepping aside if his health were to become an issue. Democratic lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have urged Biden to drop out of the race, and some believe it's only a matter of time before he does. However, Biden's campaign has rejected suggestions that he is ready to step aside, and his deputy campaign manager has stated that the president has made his decision to run for re-election.

The Pioneer,2024-10-31 00:00:00,Maha Yuti blues: BJP throws lot with MNS’ Amit Thackeray in Mahim,"In a development that exposed lack of consensus among the constituents of the ruling MahaYuti on certain issues Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said on Wednesday that the BJP was committed to supporting MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s son Amit Thackeray in Mumbai’s Mahim constituency where his party’s ally – the Shinde Shiv Sena – has put up a candidate.      

To make matters more complicated, Raj went to town claiming that after the polls, the MNS -- which is not part of the pre-poll grand alliance -- would be part of the MahaYuti government headed by a BJP chief minister.

The positions taken by Fadnavis and Raj – in statements made in separate television interviews of a Marathi television channel have led to intense speculation within the state government that the BJP would no longer back current chief minister Eknath Shinde for the current term.

If anything, Fadnavis’ open declaration that the BJP “want to support Amit Thackeray” in Mahim constituency -- where the Shinde Sena has fielded sitting party MLA Sada Sarvankar in Mahim constituency against Amit Thackeray – has set the cat among the pigeons.

On his part, Fadnavis claimed that there was consensus between him and Eknath Shinde on supporting MNS candidate Amit Thackeray, who is making an electoral debut from Mahim.

‘I am told that leaders from the Shinde-led Shiv Sena argued that if the party does not contest the election, its traditional voters would shift to the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena (UBT).  As far as we are concerned, we would like to support Amit. The  BJP is still firm on its stand,” Fadnavis said.

Fadnavis, however, hastened to add: ""When we (leaders of Mahayuti) meet, we will discuss and try to find a solution”.

Raj and Fadnavis have enjoyed close rapport over the years. The Raj Thackeray-led MNS, which did not contest the recent Lok Sabha polls, had extended its unconditional support to the BJP-led NDA in the LS polls.  

If the Shinde does not withdraw the candidature of its candidate Sada Sarvankar – who is adamant on contesting the polls, then it will be a triangular contest among the Amit Thackeray, Sarvankar (Shide Sena) and Mahesh Sawant of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena.

On the other hand, while participating in a television programme, expressed confidence that the BJP-led MahaYuti would return to power in the state.

“The political situation in Maharashtra has changed vastly during the last three months.  It now appears that the MahaYuti will come back to power in the State in the 2024 polls. One of the factors that contributed to the improved chances of the MahaYuti is the BJP’s victory in Haryana”.

The pre-poll alliance among the ruling MahaYuti and Opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) notwithstanding, “friendly fights” are being witnessed between the Yuti and MVA partners in at least 13 constituencies across the state. Full Clarity will come after the withdrawal of nominations on November 4.

From the MahaYuti, the ruling BJP is contesting 152 seats, while its allies have fielded candidates in 80 and 50 constitiences respectively.  On the MVA front, the Congress is contesting 102 seats, while the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena and NCP (Sharad Pawar) have nominated 96 and 87 seats respectively.","Maharashtra Deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis has stated that the BJP supports MNS chief Raj Thackeray’s son, Amit Thackeray, in the Mahim constituency, despite their ally, the Shinde-led Shiv Sena, fielding sitting MLA Sada Sarvankar. This has led to speculation about BJP’s future backing of CM Eknath Shinde. Raj Thackeray claimed that post-election, the MNS would be part of the MahaYuti government under a BJP CM. The contest in Mahim is now a triangular fight between Amit Thackeray (MNS), Sada Sarvankar (Shinde Sena), and Mahesh Sawant (UBT Shiv Sena). Statewide, tensions between alliance partners have led to “friendly fights” in at least 13 constituencies. Full clarity will emerge after the withdrawal of nominations on November 4.",Politics,115,536

Mr. Khamenei was leading Friday prayers and was to deliver a rare public sermon in the Iranian capital, Tehran. In a 40-minute speech, he praised Tuesday’s missile barrage against Israel as a shining job by Iranian armed forces. “It will be done in the future again if it becomes necessary,” he said.

The arunachal fort,2024-07-18 00:00:00,"Beating the odds, Pakke team rescues 400 snakes","TIPPI, 17 Jul: In a state like Arunachal Pradesh where snake rescue is a completely new concept, a team of snake rescuers belonging to the Tippi wildlife range under Pakke Tiger Reserve is making waves by rescuing more than 400 snakes to date. The rescued snakes include venomous ones like cobras, kraits and pit vipers, non-venomous ones like checkered keelback, wolf snake etc. The five members led by range forest officer (RFO) Kime Rambia of Tippi wildlife range include Hage Tamang(driver), Raju Boro (beat guard), Niranjan Boro (night guard) and Krishna Lamgu (STPF).

The idea of forming snake rescue took shape in 2013. “We carried out rigorous outreach activities at Tippi-Bhalukpong areas especially, in rural villages and schools to educate people about human-animal conflicts. Locals also responded positively. On and off we started getting distress calls for human-elephant conflict. When we started managing the conflict we also started receiving rescue calls for mammals and birds,” shared RFO Kime Rambia.


Slowly people started calling for the rescue of the snakes. However, the Tippi Wildlife range officials did not know much about snake rescue back then except for attending a few workshops organized by Gerry Martin at Pakke and Eagle Nest WLS in 2015-16. Gerry is from Karnataka and runs an organization called the Gerry Martin Project. He organizes extensive awareness of human-snake conflict

“With bare minimum knowledge, we started to try to rescue snakes. Few were successful but many failed with life-threatening experiences. I shared our misery with then DFO Tana Tapi and Gerry Martin. It was Gerry who suggested that we should go to Hunsur and learn hands-on real-life situations,” said Rambia.

Accordingly, in July 2017, five members from Pakke Tiger Reserve which include RFO Kime Rambia, Hage Tamang(driver), Raju Boro (beat guard), Sanjit Brah, STPF and Ohey Tayem, STPF were trained at Gerry’s facility in Hunsur in Karnataka. The 4 staff from Eaglenest WLS also joined.

“Our trip was sponsored by a conservation biologist and a well-wisher Shradha Rathod. Gerry was kind enough to support the stay, food and training for the entire team for 10 days. At Hunsur we learnt about snake identification, behaviour and venom status of snakes,” informed Rambia.

The team started handling and understanding their movements with non-venomous snakes first and later with venomous ones. Rescuing them by bagging, safe release and bite management were trained during the stay.

The team now carries out regular awareness and sensitization programmes about snake behaviour in and around Pakke. Based on their experience RFO Kime Rambia along with his co-author Shradha Rathod has written a book called Snakes of Pakke, which gives an account of 46 snakes found in and around Pakke.


","Summary:
In Arunachal Pradesh, the Tippi wildlife range under Pakke Tiger Reserve has initiated a successful snake rescue team, rescuing over 400 snakes to date. Led by Range Forest Officer Kime Rambia, the team includes members like Hage Tamang, Raju Boro, Niranjan Boro, and Krishna Lamgu. The team was established in 2013 following outreach activities to educate locals about human-animal conflicts, which later extended to snake rescues. Initially lacking expertise, they received training from Gerry Martin in Hunsur, Karnataka, in 2017, focusing on snake identification, behavior, venom management, and safe release techniques. The team now conducts regular awareness programs and has authored a book titled ""Snakes of Pakke"" detailing 46 snake species in the region.

The two have often praised each other at multiple public platforms. Now, a video has gone viral in which Abhishek is seen calling Aishwarya an 'amazing emotional support' in an old interview.


While promoting Dasvi with Nimrat Kaur, Abhishek told Bollywood Hungama, ""My wife is exceptional at that. She’s always been an amazing emotional support for me. I’ve been very lucky, my entire family has been. The wonderful thing about having a life partner like Aishwarya is that she is from the business. She gets it. She has been doing it slightly longer than I have. So, she knows the world. She has been through it all. So, it’s nice when you come home and if you’ve had a challenging day, you know that there’s somebody who gets it.""

""She has been somebody that, I have always noticed, has managed to traverse some of the most difficult times of her life with utmost dignity and grace. I really admire that about her.

DNA,2024-07-26 00:00:00,Paris Olympics 2024: Psychiatrist joined IOC for first time to take care of athlete’s mental health,"There is no health without mental health. Yet, for years this aspect of health has been pushed to the sidelines – in the world of sport and other avenues of life as well. In including mental wellness as part of the contingent, the Indian Olympic Association has recognized that mental health matters. In considering it as a part of the medical team in particular, it has conveyed that mental health and well-being is just as important as physical health and well-being. Such a decision not only will positively impact the upcoming Paris 2024 games, but also go a long way in shaping the future and paving the way for mental health support reaching the grassroots. 

These efforts are in line with the recent emphasis of the International Olympic Commission which has championed the cause of athlete mental health. From carrying out research across the world, to disseminating educational courses, launching a 24x7 helpline in 70 languages, providing an athlete mental health toolkit, early identification resources, the IOC has led the way. In fact, this is the first time that the Paris Olympic Village will have a dedicated MindZone.

Mental health is integral to well-being and integral to success. When we speak of mental health we’re not just talking about the absence of an illness. A complete understanding of mental health goes much beyond. According to the World Health Organization, mental health also means our ability to deal with the pressures of daily life, learn well and work well, contribute to the community and to be able to realize our potential. Each of these elements have a direct impact on sport and an athlete’s ability to perform at their peak. 
We all experience challenges; all go through our ups and downs. A few of these though are unique, or let’s say, more pronounced in the world of sport. Athletes are confronted with winning and losing every day. They spend a lot of time away from families, whether in training or competition. There are a lot of pressures and expectations to perform, under a lot of public scrutiny. The short span of play, stressors of selections, the impact of injuries and career transitions all also play a role. In high pressure situations, where the difference is often less than a couple of seconds, being able to make those few moments count. 

The need of the hour is for athletes to train themselves to deal with the pressure that comes with big sporting events. Building confidence, motivation, resilience, self-control and focus are some of the key elements of mental strength. Using strategies like visualization, muscle relaxation, self- talk, goal setting, focus training, self-regulation and mindfulness in a scientific, evidence manner, and making it a part of training through the years is the way forward. At the same time, going beyond performance and providing athletes with the right mindset and the right kind of support system to deal with the emotional challenges that come their way matters too. 

To move forward as a sporting nation, mental well-being needs to be incorporated as a core element of training. And this is must go beyond one-off instances of elite athletes taking the support of a sport psychologist. What it requires is a shift in mindset about mental health, which is reflected at the level of policy and decision making by leading sports bodies in the country. Mental skills training must be encouraged and included as part of sport training from a young age, so our athletes feel confident, have the right mindset and a positive attitude to deal with the pressures of competing. At the same time, promoting mental health literacy and imparting the right life skills to young athletes can also have a lasting impact. Most of all, we need a policy where the psychological safety of athletes is prioritized, so they can flourish and reach their true potential. These changes need to take place at all levels of sport – from grassroots academies to the elite, high performance training centres. To this end, Paris 2024 is the first, crucial step.  

","The Indian Olympic Association has taken a significant step by including mental wellness as part of the contingent, recognizing that mental health is just as important as physical health. This decision is in line with the International Olympic Commission's emphasis on athlete mental health, which has led to initiatives such as research, educational courses, and a 24x7 helpline.

The Shillong Times,2024-12-28 00:00:00,K’taka Police arrest bank manager-led gang for siphoning Rs 12.51 crore via corporate data theft,"Bengaluru, Dec 28: The Karnataka Police have arrested a gang of four individuals, led by the Manager of the Corporate Division at Axis Bank in Gujarat, for siphoning off crores of rupees by stealing sensitive data from a company, officials said on Saturday.

The Bengaluru East CEN police (Cybercrime, Economic Offences, Narcotics) apprehended the suspects and seized Rs 1.83 crore in cash, two mobile phones, and a fake Corporate Internet Banking (CIB) form, according to Bengaluru Police Commissioner B. Dayanand. The investigation began after the Director of Dream Plug Pay Tech Solutions Private Limited (CRED) in Bengaluru filed a police complaint on November 15 with the CEN East police station.

The complaint alleged the siphoning of Rs 21.51 crore from the company’s accounts and requested an investigation. According to the complaint, the company’s nodal and current bank accounts were with the Indiranagar branch of Axis Bank in Bengaluru.

Strangers had gained access to the email addresses and contact numbers associated with these accounts. The cyber fraudsters stole the company’s data, forged CIB forms, and falsified signatures and seals to facilitate the transfer of Rs 12,51,13,000 to 17 different bank accounts.

After registering the complaint, the East CEN police launched an investigation and arrested the primary suspect, who worked as the Manager of the Corporate Division at Axis Bank in Gujarat. The investigation revealed that the accused, in collusion with others, had stolen the company’s data and committed the crime.

The kingpin created fake Corporate Internet Banking (CIB) forms and Board Resolutions for the company and submitted them to the Ankleshwar branch of Axis Bank in Bharuch district, Gujarat. Using these forged documents, the accused gained access to the company’s internet banking accounts and transferred funds to 17 mule accounts in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

The four suspects were apprehended on December 20 in Surat, Navsari, and Rajkot in Gujarat. They were produced in a local court and subsequently brought to Bengaluru for further investigation. The accused were remanded to 10 days of police custody. The police recovered Rs 1.28 crore in cash and Rs 55 lakh from the mule bank accounts associated with the crime.

The case was cracked by a team led by DCP East D. Devaraj, ACP Laxmikanth of CEN East police station, and Inspector Umeshkumar. Six people were arrested in connection with cyber fraud of Rs 56 lakh in Bengaluru on December 24.

Bengaluru Police Commissioner B. Dayanand had said: “The accused duped a company by impersonating its Managing Commis Director (MD). Using the MD’s photograph and the company logo as a WhatsApp display picture, one of the accused sent a message to the company’s employee asking for an urgent transfer of Rs 56 lakh, claiming it was needed as a security deposit.”

An incident of cyber criminals conning a Japanese national and extorting Rs 35 lakh from him has been reported from Bengaluru recently. Hiroshi Sasaki, a 59-year-old Japanese national, had lodged a complaint in this regard with the South East Cybercrime, Economic offences, Narcotics (CEN) Crime police station.

An incident of a software professional losing Rs 11 crore after falling victim to digital arrest was reported from Bengaluru on December 23. According to the police, the cyber fraudsters disguised themselves as police officials from the Mumbai Crime Branch and committed the crime through digital arrest.

A case of a state government employee falling victim to cybercriminals and being robbed of Rs 19 lakh after being digitally arrested for six hours in Tumakuru district of Karnataka was reported on December 24. According to police, the accused had called the victim officer on the phone and introduced himself as a staffer from the Mumbai Crime Branch. The accused further charged that the money had been transferred illegally from his account.","The Karnataka Police arrested a gang led by an Axis Bank manager for siphoning off Rs 21.51 crore from Dream Plug Pay Tech Solutions.

Although Hasina tried to keep China in good humour, she was sensitive also to India's interests-an even-handendess which was not to
China's pleasing.
Interestingly, many leading figures of the Islamic student outfit managed to charm the western-affiliated NGOs by using jargon of
democracy and rights.
The ICS has been under the surveillance of Indian intelligence agencies for an extended period, following the emergence of its active
involvement in anti-India activities, including the propagation of a jihadist agenda in Indian territories adjacent to Bangladesh. The ICS
also operates in close coordination with the ISI-backed outfit, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al- Islami (HuJI), a Pakistan-based Deobandi terrorist group
with an affiliate in Bangladesh. There exists visual evidence of ICS members undergoing training in Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""The
ultimate objective of Jamaat or ICS is to establish a Taliban-type Govt in Bangladesh, and the ISI has been assuring them of their support
in achieving this goal. Their proximity became flagrant in the wake of the strengthening ties between the Indian and Bangladeshi
Governments,"" an intelligence officer remarked.
The support from the China's Ministry of State and Security is also suspected to have extended a helping hand as Beijing has been wary
of Hasina's 'balancing act' in its dealings with India and China. A Govt in Dhaka over which Pakistan has a leverage will surely better serve
Beijing's interests better, said an intelligence source.","Indian intelligence agencies have pointed to a coordinated effort by Pakistan's ISI, backed by Chinese support, to destabilize the government of Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh. Reports indicate the involvement of Islami Chhatra Shibir (ICS), the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, known for its anti-India stance and ties to extremist organizations.

The ICS allegedly played a key role in transforming street protests over quotas into a broader movement aimed at replacing Hasina's government with a regime favoring Pakistan and China. Intelligence sources claim that the operation was meticulously planned months in advance, with substantial financial aid from Chinese entities funneled through Pakistan.

The Jamaat-e-Islami and ICS, under ISI influence, reportedly coordinated with the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), a Pakistan-based terrorist group with an active affiliate in Bangladesh. Visual evidence suggests ICS members received training in Afghanistan and Pakistan, signaling their long-term ambition to establish a Taliban-like regime in Bangladesh.

Bangladesh, who lost the opening game by seven wickets in Dhaka, suffered a familiar collapse and were bowled out in the evening session as Keshav Maharaj bagged 5-59 and fellow spinner Senuran Muthusamy took 4-45.

Sixteen Bangladesh wickets fell on the day at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.

Rabada dismissed Najmul Hossain Shanto for nine, Mehidy Hasan Miraz for one and Mahidul Islam Ankon for a duck to finish with 5-37 while Dane Paterson got rid of Mushfiqur Rahim for nought as Bangladesh continued to wobble in the first innings.The hosts, who resumed the day on 38-4, staged a fightback from 48-8 with Mominul Haque making 82 but his dismissal shortly after lunch by Muthusamy ended his 103-run ninth-wicket stand with Taijul Islam.

Taijul was unable to frustrate the tourists further, as he became Maharaj's second victim after a defiant 30.

South Africa were even more ruthless in the second innings to seal a comfortable victory in three days despite Shanto's 36, Ankon's 29 and a late charge by Hasan Mahmud, who was unbeaten on 38 in fading light.

The Proteas will look to further boost their chances of reaching the World Test Championship final next year, when they meet Sri Lanka and Pakistan in two tests each at home starting in late November.

The Tribune,2024-12-31 00:00:00,Farmer leader Dallewal ready to take medical aid if Centre agrees to talk: Punjab to Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday granted two more days to the Punjab Government to comply with its directions on shifting farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal -- who is on fast-unto-death since November 26 – to a hospital.

“Taking into consideration the totality of circumstances and keeping the interest of justice in view, we are inclined to accept the request to afford some more time for compliance with the directions issued by this court,” a Vacation Bench of Justice Surya Kant and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia said, posting a contempt petition against the Punjab Chief Secretary and Director General of Police for further hearing on January 2, 2025.

The order came after Punjab Advocate General Gurminder Singh submitted that negotiators had visited the protest site and efforts were made for implementing the court’s order by mobilising about 7,000 personnel. Due to Punjab bandh called by farmers' organisations on Monday, there were traffic blockades.""As per the negotiators, there is a proposal given by the farmers to the Central Government that if they get an invite for a talk, then Dallewal is ready to take medical aid as desired,"" Singh said, seeking three more days for compliance.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said he had no instructions on the submissions made by the Punjab Advocate General.Maintaining that he would not like to comment on the negotiations, “Justice Kant said, “If something happens which is acceptable to all sides, we are equally happy. As of now, we are only concerned with the compliance of our orders.”

Punjab Chief Secretary KAP Sinha and Director General of Police Gaurav Yadav – who were present during the virtual hearing – were asked to remain present on the next date of hearing on Thursday as well.

On December 28, the top court had warned Sinha and Yadav that it would frame charges of contempt of court against them if its order on shifting Dallewal to a hospital was not complied with. “It’s a contempt case and the next step is known. Why shouldn’t there be charges against the Chief Secretary and the Director General of Police? Why should charges not be framed? This is the logical flow of a contempt matter,” it had told the two senior officers.

Dallewal has been on a fast-unto-death at the Khanauri border point between Punjab and Haryana since November 26 to press for the acceptance of farmers' demands.

Acting on a contempt petition filed by one Labh Singh of Mohali, the top court had on December 27 issued notice to the Punjab Government for its ‘failure’ to implement the court’s order to shift Dallewal to a hospital.On December 28, the two top officers filed separate affidavits explaining their position. However, the Bench wasn’t satisfied.

""We are not satisfied with the efforts of the state of Punjab regarding compliance of orders dated December 20. Having regard to assurance by Advocate General, we are inclined to grant more time to take appropriate steps to comply with directions. If the state of Punjab requires any assistance, we direct the Central Government to give all requisite support to ensure compliance with our directions,” it had said.  ","The Supreme Court has granted the Punjab Government two more days to comply with its order to shift farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal, who has been on a fast-unto-death since November 26, to a hospital. The court extended the deadline after Punjab's Advocate General, Gurminder Singh, explained that negotiations had been initiated with farmers, and efforts were underway to mobilize personnel for compliance. Singh requested three additional days for implementation due to a Punjab bandh disrupting traffic. The court had previously warned Punjab's Chief Secretary KAP Sinha and Director General of Police Gaurav Yadav with contempt charges for not following the order. The case will be heard again on January 2, 2025. The court emphasized its concern for compliance and urged the Central Government to assist if necessary.

Indian Express,2024-12-23 00:00:00,First-time BJP MP on whose complaint Rahul was booked over Parliament scuffle: Who is Hemang Joshi,"First-time BJP MP from Gujarat’s Vadodara, Hemang Joshi, 33, was accorded a rousing welcome upon his arrival at the Vadodara airport on Friday evening following a stormy Winter Session of Parliament, five months after he entered the Lok Sabha as the youngest MP from the state. Joshi was received by the BJP leaders and workers with bouquets.

On Thursday, when a scuffle broke out between the MPs of the ruling NDA and the Opposition INDIA bloc on the Parliament premises, Joshi was seen questioning the INDIA members and asking Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, to look at the condition of Balasore BJP MP Pratap Sarangi, who was “injured” in the melee.

Hours later, Joshi lodged a formal complaint against Gandhi over the incident at the Parliament Street police station. Delhi Police booked Gandhi under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) related to physical assault, among other charges.

“The Opposition was creating a ruckus over non-issues. This led to a 40% productivity of Parliament. No discussions could be held on the three questions I was slated to ask. It is hurtful as a young parliamentarian. The Congress has the habit of protesting against everything while the BJP allows them to protest. This was the first time that the NDA decided to protest against the false propaganda that the Opposition has resorted to by using a doctored video and the name of Dr B R Ambedkar. All this happened because of the ego of one person,” Joshi alleged after his arrival in Vadodara.

In his complaint lodged with Delhi Police, Joshi claimed that “The protest (of the NDA MPs) was against the blatant misinformation being propagated by Opposition parties led by the Congress”.

A former vice-chairman of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation’s school board, Joshi is a physiotherapist and a self-proclaimed human resource enthusiast. He has completed his Master’s in Human Resource Management from MS University. He has also worked as an HR manager at a defence start-up in Vadodara.

According to BJP insiders, Joshi has close connection with the RSS leaders. He had been an active member of the BJP’s youth wing for the past few years before taking the electoral plunge, replacing two-time MP Ranjanben Bhatt from Vadodara, a constituency once represented by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Joshi also serves as the Vadodara president of the Vallabh Youth Organisation (VYO), a body headed by spiritual leader Vrajrajkumar Goswami. He was appointed to this position after his predecessor Paresh Shah was arrested in connection with the Harni boat capsize case which led to the death of 14 people, including 12 students.

In his complaint to Delhi Police, Joshi claimed that Gandhi arrived at the Makar Dwar of Parliament around 10.40 am Thursday while the NDA MPs were staging a “peaceful protest”. “Despite the requests of the Parliament security to take the designated path provided to him, Gandhi, with malicious intention to disrupt the protest and physically harm NDA MPs, ignored the requests and forcefully barged towards the protesting MPs. He instigated other Opposition MPs to proceed with force, putting the safety of protesters in jeopardy,” his complaint stated.

Joshi alleged that the Opposition leaders “intentionally used force” to push Sarangi and Farrukhabad BJP MP Mukesh Rajput, resulting in their fall after which the TDP’s Nandyal MP Byreddy Shabari administered first-aid to them.

The Vadodara MP also claimed that he attempted to reason with Gandhi and his associates but their actions were allegedly “deliberate, malicious and bore mala fide intentions”.

While Joshi, in his complaint, urged Delhi Police to book Gandhi under sections 109 (attempt to murder), 115 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 117 (voluntarily causing hurt), 125 (endangering life and personal safety of others), 131 (use of criminal force), 351 (criminal intimidation) and 3(5) (common intention) of the BNS, the police has not registered the “attempt to murder” charge against the LoP.

","Hemang Joshi, BJP's first-time MP from Vadodara, was welcomed back after a tumultuous Winter Session in Parliament. Following a scuffle between NDA and Opposition MPs, Joshi lodged a complaint against Rahul Gandhi for allegedly instigating violence and disrupting a peaceful protest. Joshi accused Gandhi of intentionally pushing BJP MPs, resulting in injuries. He filed a formal complaint, seeking charges under multiple sections, including causing grievous harm and criminal intimidation. However, the Delhi Police did not register the ""attempt to murder"" charge against Gandhi.",Politics,83,647
The Sangai Express,2024-09-10 00:00:00,"Elon Musk may be World's 1st trillionaire by 2027, Gautam Adani in 2028: Report","New Delhi, Sep 9 : Elon Musk, the charismatic CEO of electric car maker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX, may become the world's first trillionaire by 2027, while Indian tycoon Gautam Adani may attain that status in the following year, and Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani may do so in 2033, according to an Informa Connect Academy report.
For Elon Musk, the richest in the world with USD 237 billion net worth, to become the world's first trillionaire needs to grow at an average annual growth rate of 110 per cent, the report said.
Gautam Adani, who is ranked 13th on the world billionaire index with a wealth of just under USD 100 billion, maybe the second trillionaire (net worth equal to at least one trillion US dollars) if his ports-to-power conglomerate was to continue growing at the current 123 per cent average annual rate, it added.
Rival Mukesh Ambani, now ranked Asia's richest with a networth of USD 111 billion, may achieve the same status in 2033, according to the report.
His oil-to-telecom-and-retail conglomerate is slated to hit trillion-dollar market cap status in 2035. Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd is the only Indian company projected to hit that mark.
The companies that will hit the trillion-dollar market cap mark include Taiwan's semiconductor maker TSMC, which has a market cap of USD 893.7 billion now and is expected to achieve that status in 2025.
It will be closely followed by Berkshire Hathaway, pharma giant Eli Lilly, technology company Broadcom and electric automobile firm Tesla.
The report said, ""No one in the world has claimed trillionaire status - at least not yet. However, there are some likely candidates. The following are multi-billionaires who will probably become trillionaires sooner or later"".
After Elon Musk and Gautam Adani, NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang, Indonesian mogul Prajogo Pangestu, French businessman Bernard Arnault, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg come next as prospective trillionaires.
Currently, there are only a handful of companies that have crossed the USD 1 trillion in valuation. This includes Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Saudi Aramco, and Meta. The most recent case is that of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in late August.
Nvidia also joined the USD 1 trillion club in May 2023 and reached USD 3 trillion in June, becoming the second most valuable company in the world, with Microsoft ahead and Apple behind. PTI

Financial Express ,2024-08-28 00:00:00,WhatsApp vs Telegram: Comparing the top messaging apps to help you choose the right one,"The market for messaging apps has expanded significantly in recent years. As technology has advanced and smartphones have become more prevalent, so too has the demand for efficient and convenient communication tools. In this ever-evolving world of messaging apps, WhatsApp and Telegram stand out as two of the most popular choices for users around the globe.
Both platforms offer a robust array of features, but they cater to different user needs and preferences. Here is a quick comparison that delves into the key features of WhatsApp and Telegram, highlighting their strengths and unique attributes to help you choose the right one for you.
User Interface and experience
WhatsApp boasts a user-friendly interface that prioritises simplicity and ease of use. It has a design similar to traditional text messaging apps. This helps new users quickly learn the app and its functionalities. WhatsApp has a very simple and straightforward navigation system, featuring tabs for chats, status updates, and calls. WhatsApp’s clean design and intuitive layout make it accessible for all age groups, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Telegram, on the other hand, features a more customisable interface with a variety of themes and chat backgrounds. Users get a range of personalisation options to allow the app to their preferences. Telegram’s design is slightly more complex due to its host of features but it offers more flexibility to those who enjoy a more personalised experience.

Messaging features
WhatsApp provides a comprehensive set of messaging features, including text, voice, and video messaging. The chat supports multimedia sharing such as photos, videos, and documents, and allows users to send voice messages with a simple tap. WhatsApp’s messaging is end-to-end encrypted, ensuring that only the sender and recipient can read the messages.
Telegram supports large group chats and channels. Users can create groups of up to 200,000 members and broadcast messages to unlimited subscribers through channels. Telegram also offers chat customisation options, including chat folders, pinned messages, and the ability to mute conversations for specific durations. While Telegram’s encryption is not end-to-end bydefault, it offers “Secret Chats” that can’t be forwarded to others and have a self-destruct timer.
Media sharing
WhatsApp automatically adjusts video quality and size based on your internet connection speed. For users with a faster internet connection, the default video size limit is 100MB and the resolution is 720p. However, for users with a slower internet connection, the default video size limit is reduced to 64MB and the resolution is lowered to 480p. This helps ensure optimal video quality and transmission speed, regardless of your network conditions.
Security and privacy
WhatsApp for its end-to-end encryption, which means that all messages and calls are secured and can only be accessed by the intended recipients. This encryption is enabled by default for all communications.
Telegram takes a different approach to security. While it offers encryption for “Secret Chats,” regular chats are stored in the cloud and are not end-to-end encrypted by default. Telegram’s “Secret Chats” feature provides additional security with end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages, but it requires users to manually enable this option.

Group and channel management
WhatsApp supports group chats with a maximum of 1,024 members, and administrators have limited control over group settings and permissions. Group chats are well-integrated with the app’s features, allowing for media sharing, voiceand video calls, and group notifications.
Telegram excels in group and channel management. It allows users to create large groups with up to 200,000 members and broadcast messages to unlimited subscribers through channels. Telegram’s group management tools have wide range of features such as role-based permissions, customisable group settings, and advanced moderation tools.
Both WhatsApp and Telegram offer robust messaging solutions with their unique strengths. WhatsApp is ideal for users seeking simplicity, end-to-end encryption, and seamless integration with existing messaging habits. In contrast, Telegram caters to users who value customisation, extensive group and channel features, and flexible media sharing options. Choice is yours.","WhatsApp and Telegram are two of the most popular messaging apps, each offering unique features to cater to different user preferences. WhatsApp is known for its widespread use, simplicity, and integration with phone contacts, making it easy for anyone to connect. It offers end-to-end encryption for privacy and supports various media sharing and voice/video calling. Telegram, on the other hand, is favored for its speed, cloud-based storage, and versatility, including features like large group chats, channels, and bots. It also offers end-to-end encryption in its ""Secret Chats"" mode. Telegram users appreciate its customization options and the ability to access their chats from multiple devices. While WhatsApp is often the choice for everyday, personal communication due to its user-friendly interface and reliability, Telegram appeals to those who value flexibility, privacy options, and more advanced features. Choosing between the two depends on what functionalities and privacy levels are most important to the user.",Science and Technology,151,648

Bengaluru, 22 December

Ecommerce majors Amazon and Flipkart, which are planning to scale up their quick commerce (qcom) operations, may need to invest at least $1 billion each over the next two-three years to catch up with established platforms, such as Zomato-owned Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto, according to analysts.

Qcom refers to the delivery of consumer items within 10 to 30 minutes. In August, Walmart-owned Flipkart entered the growing qcom segment with Minutes. Amazon India plans to launch Tez in January.

“They would have to invest at least $1 billion in the next 2-3 years because the other side is ready to deploy that kind of capital. If you think, “let’s invest $25 million and see how it goes”, then that will not work,” said Satish Meena, an advisor at Datum Intelligence, a consumer technology-focused market research firm.","Amazon and Flipkart are set to intensify investments in quick commerce (qcom) to compete with established players like Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart, and Zepto.

Walmik Karad, who allegedly masterminded the murder of Massajog sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh, has been absconding for the last 19 days.

Fadnavis issued the order to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) that has been probing the Santosh Deshmukh murder case. The CID visited residence of Karad and enquired his family members about his whereabouts.

Sources from the home department confirmed that Fadnavis also ordered a probe into viral pictures showing people with firearms. If the images are verified to be authentic, the government will begin the process of cancelling the gun licences of those involved, the sources said, referring to a home department order.

Leaders of all parties have demanded the resignation of NCP minister Dhanjay Munde as murder accused Karad is his aide. NCP MLA Prakash Salunkhe said that until the investigation into the murder case is completed, Munde should not remain as a minister for a fair probe. NCP (SP) MLA Sandeep Kshirsagar demanded the arrest of Karad and resignation of “his political boss Dhananjay Munde”. He said the sarpanch murder case should not been seen through the caste prism.

NCP minister Munde said that he is not protecting anyone who is involved in Massajog sarpanch killing. “I want justice for the deceased Deshmukh. The case should be tried in a fast track court. There should be harshest punishment for those who are responsible for the murder of the sarpanch even if they are close to me.

 Goa Chronicle,2024-10-11 00:00:00,Iran’s Foreign Policy and Domestic Discontent: The Growing Divide,"Over the decades, the Islamic Republic of Iran has strategically invested in various Islamist groups, most notably Hezbollah in Lebanon, Palestinian factions like Hamas, and other militant proxies across the Middle East. This investment served two core objectives: exporting the revolution envisioned by Ayatollah Khomeini and ensuring the eventual destruction of Israel, a cornerstone of Tehran’s ideological and geopolitical ambitions. However, these policies, combined with the fallout from Iran’s nuclear program, have increasingly isolated the country from the global economy.

International sanctions, particularly those targeting its energy and financial sectors, have exacerbated Iran’s economic difficulties. The regime’s involvement in conflicts such as Syria’s civil war, Iraq, and Yemen has strained national resources further, leaving little room for addressing domestic challenges. Simultaneously, political repression within Iran has intensified. Those who do not subscribe to Ayatollah Khamenei’s ideological stance or the state’s vision have been increasingly marginalized, contributing to growing social unrest.

This repression, combined with worsening economic conditions and social limitations, has fueled resentment among Iranians. For many, the government’s policies appear more focused on projecting power in the region than on addressing the pressing needs of the Iranian populace. As inflation soared and unemployment remained high, the regime’s prioritization of external causes — from the Palestinian struggle to Hezbollah’s military campaigns — became a point of contention.

This discontent came to a head in 2009 during the Green Movement, when protests erupted following a disputed presidential election. While initially focused on calls for political reform, the movement quickly became a broader critique of the regime’s foreign policy and ideological focus. Protesters chanted slogans such as “Neither Gaza nor Lebanon, I Give My Life to Iran,” expressing frustration at the regime’s apparent neglect of domestic concerns. Another popular chant, “Forget Palestine, think about us!” called for the government to shift its attention away from regional conflicts and prioritize the needs of its own citizens.

Parallel to this dissatisfaction with political Islam and foreign entanglements has been a noticeable increase in secularization within Iran. Many Iranians are growing weary of political Islam and Islamist groups that advocate for governance based on Sharia law and an Islamic constitution. This shift is evident in the rising desire for the separation of mosque and state, as well as the privatization of religion in public life. What began as dissatisfaction with the Islamic Republic’s foreign policy has transformed into broader disillusionment with the regime’s ideological commitments, including its confrontation with Israel.

Over time, a growing number of Iranians have gone from merely criticizing the regime’s support for Islamist groups to actively expressing support for Israel. Despite the Islamic Republic’s vehement anti-Israel stance, many Iranians now view Israel not as an enemy but as a modern, technologically advanced state that has thrived despite being surrounded by hostile neighbors. Israel’s high-tech sector, water management innovations, and overall resilience have become sources of admiration for some Iranians. The contrast between Iran’s economic woes and Israel’s success has only widened the gap between the regime’s anti-Israel rhetoric and the sentiments of its people.

In defiance of state propaganda, many Iranians have refused to participate in symbolic acts of hostility toward Israel and the United States. For instance, while the government paints American and Israeli flags on the streets to encourage people to walk on them as a form of protest, many Iranians refuse to do so, subtly signaling their disagreement with the regime’s narrative. This quiet defiance extends beyond symbolic acts. Some Iranian athletes, such as judoka Saeid Mollaei, have competed against Israeli opponents, despite the harsh punishments imposed by the regime for such actions.

The divide between the regime and its people became even more evident after the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. While the Islamic Republic and Ayatollah Khamenei praised Hamas’s actions as legitimate resistance against Israel, many Iranians both inside and outside the country rejected this narrative. Among the Iranian diaspora, there was widespread condemnation of Hamas, and many voiced their support for Israel, underscoring the growing disconnect between the regime’s ideology and the views of its people. Signs at various demonstrations read, “I am Persian, not a Muslim,” reflecting a broader secular trend and discontent with political Islam.

For many Iranians, groups like Hamas and Hezbollah are now seen not as champions of resistance, but as contributors to regional instability and barriers to Iran’s own progress. This sentiment reflects a profound shift in public opinion within Iran — away from political Islam and towards a future where the country’s prosperity and stability are prioritized over ideological struggles abroad. The growing admiration for Israel, despite decades of government hostility, underscores the depth of this change, as more Iranians look beyond the regime’s propaganda and toward a future that values development over conflict.","Iran has long supported Islamist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas to export its revolutionary ideology and seek Israel's destruction. However, this foreign policy focus, alongside Iran's nuclear ambitions, has isolated the country economically, worsening domestic issues like inflation and unemployment. Social unrest has grown, with protests like the 2009 Green Movement criticizing the regime's priorities. Increasing secularization within Iran reflects dissatisfaction with political Islam and foreign entanglements. Many Iranians now admire Israel for its technological progress, rejecting the regime's anti-Israel stance and Islamist rhetoric, signaling a shift in public opinion towards prioritizing Iran’s prosperity over regional conflicts.",Politics,97,786

indian express,2024-07-13 00:00:00,What caused the rare failure of SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket,"The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday grounded SpaceX’s Falcon 9 — one of the world’s most active rockets — after the failure of its upper stage engine that stranded 20 Starlink internet satellites in a low, non-survivable orbit. The failed mission ended a remarkable streak of more than 300 successful Falcon 9 flights in the last nine years.

What is Falcon 9?
Falcon 9 is a partially reusable rocket designed and manufactured by Elon Musk-owned SpaceX. It can transport crew and payloads to low Earth orbit (an altitude of 2000 km or less) and beyond.

The rocket has two stages. The first stage or booster stage comprises nine Merlin engines (a family of rocket engines developed by SpaceX), and aluminium-lithium alloy tanks containing liquid oxygen and rocket-grade kerosene propellant. The second stage consists of a single Merlin engine.
The first stage, which is reusable, is capable of re-entering the atmosphere, and landing vertically after separating from the second stage.

What went wrong with Falcon 9?
The issue occurred roughly 30 minutes after the launch of Falcon 9 from the Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Thursday night. The rocket’s second stage experienced a liquid oxygen leak, and failed to complete a second, short engine burn needed to put 20 Starlink satellites in the correct orbit, according to a post on SpaceX’s website.

“After a planned relight of the upper stage engine to raise perigee — or the lowest point of orbit — the Merlin Vacuum engine experienced an anomaly and was unable to complete its second burn,” SpaceX said.
Although the stage survived and still deployed the satellites, it did not successfully circularise its orbit. This left the satellites in an eccentric orbit with a very low perigee of 135 kilometres (84 miles), which is less than half the expected perigee altitude.”","The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket after a failure in its upper stage engine stranded 20 Starlink satellites in a non-survivable low orbit.

Mint,2024-07-01 00:00:00,Nilekani wins Infy seat; no-votes rise,"In what has come as a surprise to industry watchers, Nandan Nilekani faced stiff opposition from public shareholders in his reappointment as director of Infosys Ltd.

Conversations Mint had with shareholders point to the dissent likely being a reaction to the Infosys chairman’s absence from some board meetings, his profile of a non-independent director, and lack of clarity about his tenure as a director.

As per an exchange filing by Infosys, 35% of retail shareholders and 15% of public institutions opposed Nilekani’s reappointment at the company’s 43rd annual general meeting (AGM) on 26 June.

In contrast, his earlier reappointments in 2019 and 2022 faced less than 1% opposition from public institutions and non-institutions.

“The opposition to his re-appointment is surprising,” said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research Services.

However, Nilekani’s candidature sailed through despite the dissent as he secured 86% of the overall votes. The co-founder of Infosys does not have a fixed tenure at the company, and seeks reappointment every two-odd years.

“The reason he still secured a majority is because his attendance in board meetings has been more than 75% in the last three years, which is what all proxy advisory firms and investors demand,” added Subramanian. “However, we have made a note of his absence.”

Retail shareholders and non-institutions own about a fourth of Infosys’s total shares; public institutions own 62%, while promoters own 13%.

An email sent to Infosys seeking responses went unanswered.

The resistance to Nilekani’s candidature at Infosys comes after 40% of large shareholders of Reliance Industries Ltd rejected the appointment of Saudi Arabian businessman Yasir Al-Rumayyan as an independent director as he skipped about 25% of the company’s board meetings.

Nilekani, too, missed one-third of the company’s board meetings in the 12 months through March 2024. The company’s board met six times (excluding the AGM) and Nilekani attended four of them.

“We are voting against this director for missing more than 25% of scheduled meetings without a satisfactory reason,” a spokesperson of British Columbia Investment Management Corp., a Canadian pension fund, said. “We are voting against the non-independent Chair as we support the separation of board and management with an independent Chair.”

Royal London Asset Management, which has $210 billion in assets, also said the chairman is not independent and “we would prefer to see the appointment of a fully independent chairman to the board”.

The California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS), which has about $500 billion in assets under management (AUM and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, which manages $640 billion of assets, were two other big investors opposed to Nilekani’s reappointment.

An analysis by Mint revealed that Nilekani’s attendance at board meetings had fallen over the past two years. He attended the meetings regularly until March 2022, but was at only four of the six meetings held last year, despite the company having had the fewest annual board meetings since he took over as chairman in 2017.

One retail shareholder of Infosys said he voted against the resolution as Nilekani does not have a stated tenure. “Good corporate governance demands board members to disclose their tenure,” said the Bengaluru-based shareholder, who claims to have owned Infosys shares for two decades.","Nandan Nilekani's reappointment as Infosys director faced unexpected opposition from public shareholders, with 35% of retail and 15% of institutional shareholders voting against him. Concerns centered on his board meeting attendance, non-independent director status, and lack of a defined tenure. Despite this, he secured 86% of overall votes. Shareholders cited his absence from some meetings and preference for an independent chairman. Large investors like CalPERS and Royal London Asset Management also opposed his reappointment. Nilekani's board attendance has decreased in recent years, raising governance concerns. His reappointment ultimately succeeded due to his overall meeting attendance exceeding 75%.",Business and Finance,97,535

They have also disconnected more than 2.75 lakh SIP DID/Mobile Numbers/Telecom resources, the statement added.

These steps are expected to have a significant impact on reducing spam calls and providing relief to consumers, the ministry said.

TRAI urges all stakeholders to comply with the directives and contribute to a cleaner and more efficient telecom ecosystem.

The call for compliance follows TRAI’s issuance of stringent directives to all Access Providers on August 13.

TRAI mandated Access Providers to immediately stop promotional voice calls from unregistered senders or telemarketers using SIP, PRI, or other telecom resources.

TRAI had stated that any unregistered telemarketers found misusing these resources will face severe consequences, including the disconnection of all telecom resources for up to two years and blacklisting.

TRAI took this step after observing a significant rise in spam calls, with over 7.9 lakh complaints reported against unregistered telemarketers in the first half of 2024 (January to June).

Pointing to the terror incidents in the Jammu region, Mr Sinha said, ""The incidents are sad. We acknowledge them and want to
assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir and the country that these incidents will definitely be controlled. The neighbouring
country will not succeed in its evil designs.""
""Pakistan is the birthplace of terrorism, it emanates from there. India and the Jammu and Kashmir administration are making
concerted efforts to counter it, with several other countries also contributing to these efforts,"" he told PTI.
The L-G exuded full faith in the Army, CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police to control the situation, and said, ""You will see a
big change in the coming three months."" ""The neighbouring country is pushing in foreign terrorists to spoil the situation here.

days,"" he said.
Asked to comment about Pakistan's continuance in fomenting trouble in Jammu and Kashmir, he said, ""We seem to be
unaware of the internal situation in Pakistan. The country cannot even provide food to its own people. Because of this, Jammu
and Kashmir has become a favourite subject for them.""
""The country fails to accept that India defeated it in wars; hence, it continues to attempt to destabilize the region. On the
international front, there has been an increase in support for India. Even during the abrogation of Article 370, some countries,
whose viewpoints differed from ours,","Lieutenant Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Manoj Sinha, has accused Pakistan of sending highly trained foreign terrorists into the region to destabilize its security.

The Navhind Timeserma,2024-07-10 00:00:00,2 more iron ore leases likely to get green nod soon,"Panaji: Two iron ore mining leases in the state – the Monte de Sirigao Block III and the Advalpale-Thivim Block V – are close to getting the environment clearances (ECs), with the State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC) giving the green nod to the blocks and recommending to the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), the grant of ECs to these blocks.

While recommending EC to the two mineral blocks, the SEAC noted that the two leases are under the provisions of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. Further, the project proponents are under an obligation to obtain approvals under any other Act as applicable to the projects.

In its report, the SEAC said that the grant of ECs is conditional, as it is subject to the outcome of two public interest litigations (PILs) – writ petition 592 of 2022 (MSPL vs the state of Goa), challenging the constitutionality of the tender documents of phase I of the auction, and writ petition 2029 of 2023 (Suresh Govind Gaonkar & others vs the directorate of mines), challenging the state’s decision to go ahead with the auction of mines.

The report states that the two project proponents must be permitted by the state government to resume operations after they pay up compensation, if any.it states that compensation, if any, should be paid to the directorate of mines and geology for illegal mining in compliance with the Supreme Court judgment of August 17, 2017.

The other conditions imposed by SEAC relate to complying with the action plan made during the public hearing and monitoring of air, water and noise quality during mining. The SEAC has also directed the two project proponents to declare their mining capacity of 20 million tonnes under the annual mining cap imposed for the state by the Supreme Court.The SEAC recommendation of ECs to the two mineral blocks was made at its 207th meeting.

It may be noted that the public hearing for the Monte de Sirigao mineral block III took place on January 18 this year, while hearing for the Advalpale-Thivim mineral block V was held on March 15.

The Monte de Sirigao mineral block III was auctioned in the first round of bidding in December 2022, while Fomento Resources won the Advalpale-Thivim mineral block V in the second round of bidding (Phase II) in April 2023.

As of date, only one EC, granted to Vedanta Ltd. for Bicholim mineral block I, is operational in the state.



","In Panaji, Goa, two iron ore mining leases, Monte de Sirigao Block III and Advalpale-Thivim Block V, are nearing environmental clearances.

Kainkarya is a word that has deep significance in the Visishtadvaitic tradition. It goes beyond service to Bhagavan on this earth alone. It extends to Sri Vaikuntha too. For Sri Vaishnavas, serving the Lord is not just a means to moksha, but continues in Sri Vaikuntha. The kainkarya that we do for Him is parama purushartha, said Kazhiyur B. Devarajan in a discourse.

Deccan Chronicle ,2024-10-20 00:00:00,"CNG price may go up Rs 4-6 on input supply cut, excise duty cut to ease situation","New Delhi: The government has slashed by up to 20 per cent the supplies of cheaper domestically produced natural gas to city retailers -- a move that may result in Rs 4-6 per kg hike in the price of CNG sold to automobiles, unless excise duty on the fuel is cut, sources said.Natural gas pumped from below the ground and from under the seabed from sites ranging from the Arabian Sea to Bay of Bengal within India is the raw material that is turned into CNG for sale to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.
Production from legacy fields, whose price is regulated by the government and which are used to feed city gas retailers, has been falling by up to 5 per cent annually due to natural decline that has set in. This has led to supply cuts to city gas retailers, four sources in know of the matter said.

While the input gas for piped cooking gas that households get is protected, the government has cut supply of raw material for CNG. Gas from legacy fields used to meet 90 per cent of the demand for CNG in May 2023 and has progressively fallen. The supply was cut to just 50.75 per cent of the CNG demand beginning October 16 from 67.74 per cent last month, they said.
City gas retailers are forced to buy imported and costlier liquefied natural gas (LNG) to make up for the shortfall, which will lead to a hike in CNG prices that varies from Rs 4-6/kg.

The gas from legacy fields is priced at USD 6.50 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) as against imported LNG that costs USD 11-12 per mmBtu.

For now, the retailers have not raised CNG rates as they are engaged with the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to find a solution, sources said.
One of the options is for the government to cut excise duty on CNG. Currently, the central government levies a 14 per cent excise duty on CNG, which translates into Rs 14-15 per kg. If this is cut, the retailers will not have to pass on the increased cost to consumers, they said.

CNG price hike is also a political issue since Maharashtra goes to the polls next month and elections are also due in Delhi soon. Delhi and Mumbai are among the biggest CNG markets in the country.
Sources said the gas supplies to city gas retailers had to be cut after the government decided to restore fuel to ONGC-promoted OPaL petrochemical plant in Dahej, Gujarat.

The plant was originally allocated 4.12 million standard cubic meters per day of domestically produced natural gas. However, the allocation for various reasons was cut to 1.95 mmscmd and during Covid was halved.

Lack of promised domestic gas was the main reason for OPaL running into losses, sources said, adding that the government has now approved a package to revive the unit. This package includes promoter Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) infusing additional Rs 10,501 crore as equity and the unit being made available domestically produced natural gas.

The Union Cabinet approved the allocation of 3.44 mmscmd of domestic gas -- mostly coming from new wells of ONGC. This led to lesser gas being available for city gas retailers.

Girish Kadam, Senior Vice President & Group Head - Corporate Ratings, Icra Ltd, said, ""The APM gas allocation has been reduced for the CGD sector by 20 per cent of the current domestic gas consumption by the sector. The reduction in APM allocation will have to be replaced by more expensive HPHT gas or (imported) LNG, which will push the overall gas costs for the sector.""

To maintain contribution margins at existing levels, CNG prices will have to be increased about Rs 5-5.5 per kg.

Indraprastha Gas Ltd, which retails CNG in the national capital, and Mumbai-based Mahanagar Gas Ltd in regulatory filings stated that supplies of domestically produced gas, which was available at a capped rate half of the imported price, has been cut.

""The company gets domestic gas allocation for meeting the requirement of CNG sales volumes at the pricing fixed by the government (presently at USD 6.5 per million British thermal unit). Based on communication received by the company from GAIL (India) Ltd (the nodal agency for domestic gas allocation), this is to inform that there has been a major reduction in domestic gas allocation to the company effective from October 16, 2024,"" IGL said in a filing.

The revised domestic gas allocation to IGL is about 21 per cent less than previous allocation, ""which will have an adverse impact on profitability of the company"", it said, adding that it is in discussions with key stakeholders to minimise the impact.
Separately, MGL said as per Policy Guideline dated August 10, 2022, issued by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, domestically produced Administrative Price Mechanisms (APM) natural gas is to be allocated to city gas distribution (CGD) companies for priority segments, specifically domestic piped natural gas and CNG (transport).

The policy states that the supply of domestic gas to CGD entities will be made only up to the quantity available and allocated to GAIL (India) limited for these segments.
""...the company is exploring options of sourcing gas through domestically produced high pressure high temperature (HPHT) gas, new well/well intervention gas (NWG) from ONGC and benchmark-linked long-term gas contracts, so as to continue to provide gas to its customers with price stability,"" MGL added.

Adani Total Gas Ltd -- the other significant city gas retailer -- in its filing said the APM priced domestic gas allocation to the company has been reduced by about 16 per cent, effective October 16, 2024, compared to the earlier allocation.

""While the company shall take all steps needed to optimise the profitability, it may however be noted that pending the resolution, there would be an adverse impact on the profitability of the company,"" it said.","The Indian government has reduced supplies of domestically produced natural gas for city retailers by up to 20%, potentially raising CNG prices by Rs 4-6 per kg. Retailers may need to rely on more expensive LNG to compensate for the shortfall, impacting profitability amid upcoming elections in Maharashtra and Delhi.

He was virtually addressing as chief guest at the UGC Western Zone Conference for Autonomous Colleges on implementing the NEP 2020 organised at the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Nagpur on Wednesday. The Governor inaugurated the conference in the presence of Professor M Jagdish Kumar, Chairman, UGC and Dr Bhimaraya Metri, Director of IIM Nagpur. Academic mentors, directors, principals, and 500 delegates from about 240 autonomous institutions in the Western Zone of India attended the conference. Radhakrishnan said, “Currently our country is ahead in the education sector offering high-quality education at every stage due to top-tier academic resources, world-class infrastructure, and ground-breaking avenues for research. “The NEP 2020 is a transformative step in this direction as it can create long-lasting change in the coming years. It sets forth ambitious goals to bring transformational reforms in education, thus, positioning India as a global knowledge superpower.
 
It also ensures that the education system provides high-quality learning to all regardless of economic or social background. It will increases gross enrollment ratio from the current 28% to 50% by 2035 and nurtures graduates from the higher education system,” the Governor said. By achieving such goals, the country can realise the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047. With an emphasis on collective efforts to realise the objectives of NEP 2020 as per the guiding pillars of access, equity, quality, affordability, and accountability. The reforms will elevate the quality of education by focusing on core values, cognitive skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities, the Governor mentioned. NEP 2020 emphasises multidisciplinary holistic education, institutional autonomy, quality research through the National Research Foundation, professional development for teachers, and technology integration. The recommendations are internationalisation of higher education, governance restructuring, and multilingual education promotion. University Grants Commission (UGC) initiated nearly 50 actions to enable higher education institutions to implement NEP 2020.
 
They create a flexible, multidisciplinary, globally benchmarked higher education ecosystem in India. Academic Bank of Credits, National Credit Framework, and Professor of Practice will transform the landscape by fostering student mobility, credit transfer, and industry-academia collaboration to prepare relevant graduates in today’s global job market. “The ‘Apprenticeship Embedded Degree Programme’ is a game-changer. IIM Nagpur is an ideal venue for such conferences as it is distinguished by its commitment to addressing the needs of modern India with innovative management education and research. Its rapid growth and achievements by adopting NEP 2020 are commendable,” the Governor pointed out. Professor M Jagdish Kumar, said “Optimism drives India on the path to progress. It has many great institutions, excellent constitution, great democracy, and a solid judicial system.” “With the world’s most significant education infrastructure, India is the 3rd largest student ecosystem. We also have many challenges to overcome in which educators attending the conference have significant roles to play.
 
This conference will create awareness for exploring the best practices, understand the challenges and find suitable solutions for rapid implementation of NEP 2020. UGC plans to launch many innovative programs in on-line and off-line modes to serve the purpose,” he mentioned. Dr Bhimaraya Metri, said that as one of the new-generation IIMs established in 2015, it has carved out a prominent position in management education with innovative programmes like Cybersecurity and Blockchain. “NEP is a gold standard and with NEP 2020 implementation more autonomy is possible for the educators who understand the valuable advantages of NEP and they should consider this as the right time to transform their institutions and offer students new avenues more effectively,” he said. He also emphasised that enhancing research culture is an effective strategy NEP 2020 recommends, and flexibility is a crucial benefit of NEP 2020. The conference was divided into 8 themes. The dignitaries were involved in different sessions. A short film on NEP 2020, produced by the UGC, was also shown during the conference.","Governor of Maharashtra, C.P.

the orissa times ,2024-12-28 00:00:00,Repeated damage to wearing coat of Joda flyover sparks fear,"Joda: The wearing coat of the flyover bridge constructed in Joda in Odisha’s Keonjhar district has been repeatedly getting damaged. The lack of uniformity in the structure’s construction is reportedly the primary reason behind the recurring damage.

The consultancy agency is carrying out regular repairs but the problems in the flyover’s permanent structure have not been adequately addressed. This has led to dissatisfaction among the public. Concerns have also been raised about the concealment of structural defects during the construction as residents cast doubt on the durability and stability of the flyover.According to an engineer, during the construction of the flyover, four beams were installed between two pillars to provide horizontal stability to the deck. A wearing coat was then applied to the deck for durability. While proper alignment of the deck and the wearing coat is essential for durability of the structure, the flyover at Joda appears to deviate from these standards.

In several parts of the flyover, the wearing coat has peeled off, leaving hollow spaces and potholes. The thickness of the wearing coat ranges inconsistently from 30 millimetres in some places to 300 millimetres in others, whereas it should measure uniformly between 75 and 100 millimetres. Additionally, the mixture used in the wearing coat contains improperly blended sand and small aggregates like chips, making it susceptible to damage under heavy vehicular traffic.

Experts suggest such issues can be avoided in the future if the main structure is properly levelled and the coat applied evenly. As per the agreement between the Odisha Bridge Construction Corporation Ltd. (OBCC) and the consultancy agency Chevrox Construction Pvt Ltd., the agency would handle maintenance work on the flyover for four years.

Despite ongoing repairs, the structural defects remain unresolved, raising serious safety concerns regarding the flyover’s ability to handle heavy vehicle movement after the maintenance period ends.

Keonjhar MP’s nominee, Rabindra Das, alleged that the then BJD government pressured the consultancy agency to complete the works in haste and handover the flyover for inauguration ahead of the election with hopes of gaining votes. As a result, the agency rushed the work, leading to structural flaws.

Das emphasised the need to form a committee comprising the engineer involved in fl yover construction to investigate the issues and carry out permanent repairs. He warned that failing to act could result in the collapse of the fl yover, posing serious threat to lives and property.

When contacted, Chevrox’s project manager Subhankar Debnath evaded replying to a question as to why the flyover’s wearing coat is peeling off, and redirected the matter to OBCC for clarification.

Notably, the Joda flyover, the longest in the state, was inaugurated March 11, 2024. The project construction was funded with approximately Rs 250 crore from the District Mineral Foundation (DMF). The consultancy agency had then claimed the flyover was designed to last 100 years. However, significant problems arose even before one year of its completion.","The Joda flyover in Odisha's Keonjhar district is facing recurring damage to its wearing coat, which has raised concerns about its structural integrity. The damage is attributed to a lack of uniformity in construction, with the wearing coat peeling off, leaving potholes and hollow spaces. The thickness of the coat varies inconsistently, and the mixture used is prone to damage from heavy traffic. Despite ongoing repairs by the consultancy agency, Chevrox Construction Pvt Ltd., structural defects remain unresolved, threatening the flyover's long-term stability. Allegations have been made that the previous government rushed the construction for political gains, which led to hasty work and defects. Local leaders are calling for an investigation and permanent repairs to ensure the safety of the flyover, which was funded with Rs 250 crore and was inaugurated in March 2024.

“The vertical lift span which was assembled here on Rameswaram side of the bridge has been slowly moved to its centre portion over the navigational channel,” an official of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited, which is executing the project said.

The 72.5-metre-long vertical single lift span could be moved up and down to facilitate movement of ships under the bridge.

The lift had been moved inch-by-inch some 450 metres over the last few weeks.

The work to make the lift operational would be completed along with the launching of remain four girders, out of the total 100 girders, by August 31.

Three girders on Rameswaram side and one girder on Mandapam side were not launched in order to provide space for facilitating the movement of the centre span.

The new bridge with single railway line will replace the old Pamban rail bridge built in 1914. However, the new bridge has provision for second line.

The work which began in 2019 was scheduled to be completed in two years. But, the outbreak of COVID and related lockdown delayed the work.

Meanwhile, Southern Railway had to abruptly stop operation of train services on the old Pamban rail bridge in December 2022 owing to safety concerns.

The trains bound to Rameswaram are being short-terminated at Mandapam railway station.

Southern Railway has planned to commission the new bridge by last week of September. Accordingly, General Manager, R.N. Singh, has asked the railway officials to plan resumption of train services between Mandapam and Rameswaram from October 1.

He has instructed to open passenger reservation upto to Rameswaram. The officials should also ensure power supply, signalling and communication arrangements and fitness of track by September 30.

Hindustan Times ,2024-10-19 00:00:00,Baba Siddique shot dead: Son Zeeshan's photo found in shooter's phone days after NCP leader's murder,"A week after Baba Siddique was killed, his son MLA Zeeshan Siddique's photo was recovered from the phone of one of the accused in the attack.
A photo of NCP MLA Zeeshan Siddique was reportedly recovered from the phone of one of the accused arrested for the murder of his father Baba Siddique during a police investigation.
Bandra East MLA Zeeshan Siddique with his late father Baba Siddique in Mumbai. A day after Baba Siddique's death, Shubham's brother Pravin Lonkar put up a post on Facebook claiming that the Lawrence Bishnoi gang was behind the murder.

Earlier in the investigation, the accused had revealed that Zeeshan Siddique was also a target.
The accused also revealed to the police that Shubham Lonkar chose Dharmaraj Kashyap and Shivakumar Gautam because they would not be aware of Baba Siddique's stature in Maharashtra and would have committed the murder without any qualms.

On Saturday, the Mumbai crime branch stated that the arrested accused Ram Kanojia and Nitin Sapre were the first to be given the contract to kill the Nationalist Congress Party leader and had initially demanded one crore rupees.

Kanojia, who hails from Maharashtra, knew the consequences of killing Baba Siddiqui, which is why he was he was hesitant and demanding more money.

The police so far have arrested nine people - including two of the three shooters and Shubham Lonkar.

The others - Nitin Sapre (32), Sambhaji Kisan Pardhi (44), Pradeep Dattu Thombre (37), Chetan Dilip Pardhi and Ram Kanoujia (43), allegedly provided firearms and logistical support to the shooters.
Three more accused, including one of the shooters are still on the run, the Mumbai police said.

Baba Siddique was shot by three men near his son's office in Nirmal Nagar in Mumbai on October 12. The NCP leader was rushed to Lilavati Hospital where he was declared dead.

He had reported getting threats 15 days before his death and had been given Y category security status, although only one constable was present with him when he was shot.

The constable was unable to protect the senior politician due to a “chilli-like” substance entering his eyes. The killers had set off a device that covered the area in thick smoke, to mask the sound of the gunfire and obscure the view of the shooting, reported NDTV. The constable, Shyam Sonawane, has now been suspended by the Mumbai police for not taking action.","A week after the murder of Baba Siddique, his son, NCP MLA Zeeshan Siddique, was revealed to be a target in the attack, with a photo of him found on the phone of one of the accused.

Many times method acting does take a toll on the actor, and he or she might get affected negatively by it.
Shah Rukh Khan is one such superstar who never fails to entertain his fans and moviegoers. The actor has stunned his audience time and again with his performances. However one of his films affected his personal life. This movie, a remake of a classic novel was a blockbuster and even won him several accolades, but he turned alcoholic.
Devdas, the Sanjay Leela Bhansali's directorial was the highest-grossing movie if 2002, and Khan's performance as the alcoholic lover Dev Babu was appreciated by the masses and critics. However, after the movie, Shah Rukh got addicted to alcohol. 
In a new interaction from the Locarno Film Festival, the actor revealed he resorted to method acting for the role, which worked in his favour and against him.
When asked if his prep for Devdas turned out well, Khan responded that it did professionally as it made him won the Best Actor award. However, he also added that it took a toll on his health. “It might have helped, but I started drinking after the film and that’s one downside to it,” SRK said.
Before Shah Rukh, veterans stepped into the shoes of Devdas and captured the audience's imagination. When asked if he was sceptical about playing the iconic character, he said, ""I didn’t think I could play the character because some of the greatest artistes in our country like Dilip Kumar, KL Saigal and Uttam Kumar had played it flawlessly earlier. I don’t think mine (his portrayal) is so brilliant or good. In spite of a lot of senior actors telling me not to do it, I just wanted to do it.""
About Devdas 
Sanjay Leela Bhansali's interpretation of Devdas followed that of Bimal Roy in 1955, which starred Dilip Kumar in the titular role.

Jackie Shroff as Chunri Babu, Kirron Kher, Tiku Talsania, and Dina Pathak were also part of the ensemble cast.

After second-half revenues recovered, the 2024 budget deficit will likely come in much lower than the official estimate, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Thursday at a ceremony marking the first stocks trading day of 2025. That’s despite increased state spending last year.

“This is an extraordinary result — smaller, much smaller, than the first-half report in which we predicted the deficit would close at 2.7%” of gross domestic product, she said. “This means that our state budget will close in 2024 relatively healthy and safe, which will be a strong position for 2025.”The comments were her first since Prabowo shocked markets with his New Year’s Eve decision to pare back a value-added tax hike from 11% to 12%, with the higher levy now only applying to luxury items like private jets and yachts. The rupiah fell as much as 1% to 16,259 against the dollar, before trading at 16,225 at 10:37 a.m. in Jakarta. 

The rupiah was by far the biggest loser on Thursday among the most-actively traded Asian currencies. Yields on Indonesia’s 5- and 10-year papers were mostly unchanged.

“While the government’s decision to cancel the VAT hike is positive for GDP growth and inflation, it makes the government look inconsistent and imprudent to investors,” said Lionel Priyadi, a macro strategist at PT Mega Capital Indonesia. “Investors are now pricing in regulatory uncertainty and greater fiscal risks.”While an across-the-board VAT hike had been expected to raise roughly 75 trillion rupiah ($4.6 billion), the watered-down increase will likely bring in only 3.2 trillion rupiah in state revenues, Mukhamad Misbakhun, who chairs the parliamentary commission overseeing financial affairs, said in a statement on Wednesday.

“This is a difficult choice that President Prabowo’s government must make for the sake of supporting purchasing power,” Misbakhun said.

Prabowo’s decision came after economic growth dipped to a one-year low in the third quarter as Indonesia struggled with weak consumption and a spate of job layoffs in the manufacturing sector. Business and labor groups had warned that a VAT hike could further sap momentum from Southeast Asia’s largest economy. However, it will be a delicate balancing act for the government as VAT accounts for roughly 25% of total tax receipts. Prabowo plans to ramp up spending this year to fulfill his campaign pledges, including a $30-billion free meal program, school renovations, free medical check-ups, and other big-ticket projects.

Indrawati said the government will still continue with efforts to accelerate growth, including measures planned to mitigate the impact of the VAT hike, had it been fully implemented.

“The stimulus won’t be retracted,” she said. “We will still give the stimulus.”

The budget deficit for 2025 is also estimated at 2.53% of GDP, well below the 3% legal limit.

“While the news looks less favorable at the outset,” it should be noted that the VAT hike was not factored into the 2025 state budget projections, said Alan Lau, an FX strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd in Singapore. The rupiah’s weakening “could also be due to the lower liquidity as markets gradually return from the festive season.”","Indonesia's rupiah fell nearly 1% after President Prabowo scaled back a VAT hike, raising concerns about fiscal stability. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani assured a healthy 2024 budget deficit below 2.7% of GDP.

The Hindu,2024-09-01 00:00:00,Pavel Durov | The prophet of privacy ,"The cause of free speech may have found a new icon in Russia-born tech tycoon Pavel Durov, who was arrested in Paris on August 24. Mr. Durov, 39, is the founder of Telegram, a cloud-based social media and instant messaging service with 950 million active users, which makes it bigger than X (540 million users).

French authorities had a warrant out for Mr. Durov and his brother Nikolai as part of a preliminary investigation into allegations that Telegram was enabling criminality through its ‘hands-off’ approach to moderating content. Mr. Durov, as the owner of Telegram, has been charged with complicity in a range of crimes, including drug trafficking, fraud, money-laundering, organised crime, terrorism, cyberbullying, dissemination of child pornographic materials, and refusal to cooperate with law enforcement. Though he has been granted bail on a bond of €5 million, he has been barred from leaving France and must sign in with the police twice a week.Telegram, in a statement, has said that “it is absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform”. a sentiment that goes to the heart of a growing conflict between owners of tech platforms and government regulators who want on-demand access to user information. Tech titans, most of whom veer libertarian in their politics, view these demands as violations of user privacy and free speech.

Mr. Durov, who describes Telegram as “a privacy-focussed social media platform” famously said in 2015, “Privacy, ultimately, is more important than our fear of bad things happening,” — a remark that endeared him to free speech evangelists.

EDITORIAL | ​Reasonable restrictions: On Telegram CEO Pavel Durov’s arrest and content hosting

Understandably, his arrest has sparked a fierce debate on the fine line between free speech rights and law enforcement. Edward Snowden, the celebrated whistleblower, had no doubt whatsoever, posting on X, “The arrest of @Durov is an assault on the basic human rights of speech and association. I am surprised that Macron has descended to the level of taking hostages as a means for gaining access to private communications.”

The French President defended the arrest, stating, “In a state governed by the rule of law, freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life.”

It has since emerged that Emmanuel Macron had met with Mr. Durov several times, was instrumental in fast-tracking his French citizenship,, and in 2018, had beseeched him to run Telegram out of France.

Right now, for instance, while his persecutor is a democracy that takes pride in championing ‘Liberte’, at the forefront of defending his liberty are two authoritarian regimes — Russia and the UAE.

DNA,2024-08-28 00:00:00,LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka finally breaks silence on KL Rahul's future at IPL franchise,"Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka broke his silence on the ongoing rumors surrounding the retention of franchise captain KL Rahul. The statement came after a meeting between Goenka and Rahul at the RPSG Group founder and chairman's office in Kolkata.

Earlier this year, during the IPL 2024 season, a video from the LSG dugout went viral, showing Goenka engaged in a discussion with Rahul after a heavy loss against Sunrisers Hyderabad. The cricketing community criticized Goenka for his actions, leading to speculation about Rahul's future with the franchise. However, the incident was later clarified as a candid discussion between the owner and captain, followed by a dinner hosted by Goenka.

Despite Goenka's efforts to clarify the situation, rumors persisted about a strained relationship between him and Rahul, with the possibility of Rahul not being retained for the 2025 IPL season. Reports even suggested that Rahul's former franchise, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, was interested in signing him.
In response to the growing speculation, Goenka addressed the potential retention of Rahul but chose to keep the suspense alive.

""I don’t want to comment on speculation. All I will say is KL Rahul is family,"" he was quoted by Revsportz on Wednesday.

Rahul, who is no longer a part of India's T20 format, joined Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in 2022 and successfully led the team to the playoffs in consecutive seasons. Despite their failure to secure a hat-trick in 2024, critics attributed the team's success in 2022 and 2023 to Gautam Gambhir's strategic leadership. Gambhir, however, left LSG to join the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024.

Recently, it was reported by PTI that LSG did not confirm Rahul's retention in the franchise, even after the player expressed his desire to stay, due to the lack of clarity from the BCCI regarding the rules for the upcoming auction.

""Yes, Rahul came to Kolkata and met Dr Goenka at RPG head office. He has clearly told Dr Goenka that he wants to be retained. However, till BCCI comes up with retention policy, LSG management wouldn't want to chalk out their plans,"" an IPL Governing Council member, privy to developments in LSG, told PTI on the condition of anonymity.

""Look, Rahul wants retention but till LSG knows how many are to be retained and what's the new purse, they can't commit anyone,"" the IPL source said.

","Lucknow Super Giants owner Sanjiv Goenka has finally broken his silence on the rumors surrounding the retention of franchise captain KL Rahul. Goenka met with Rahul in Kolkata to discuss team composition and potential retention, but refused to comment on speculation, stating that Rahul is ""family"". The meeting comes after a viral video showed Goenka engaged in a discussion with Rahul during the IPL 2024 season, leading to speculation about their relationship. Despite clarifying the incident, rumors persisted about Rahul's future with the franchise. Rahul has expressed his desire to stay with LSG, but the franchise is waiting for clarity from the BCCI on retention policies before making any decisions. The uncertainty has led to reports that Royal Challengers Bengaluru may be interested in signing Rahul.

The Indian Express,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Cabinet approves Rs 3,300 crore chip assembly plant by Kaynes Semicon in Gujarat","The Union Cabinet Monday cleared a semiconductor assembly and testing plant being set up by Kaynes Semicon at a cost of Rs 3,300 crore. This is the fifth semiconductor unit, and the fourth assembly unit, to receive Cabinet approval under India’s ambitious Rs 76,000 crore chip manufacturing incentive scheme.

“The capacity of this unit will be 60 lakh chips per day… The chips produced in this unit will cater to a wide variety of applications which include segments such as industrial, automotive, electric vehicles, consumer electronics, telecom, mobile phones, etc.” the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) said in a statement.

The plant will be constructed in Sanand, Gujarat. It is understood that the plant was initially to come up in Telangana, but was moved to Gujarat, after the government indicated that Sanand was coming up as a cluster for chip assembly plants. It is also learnt that the government’s subsidy towards the plant will be around Rs 1,300 crore.

India has ambitions to become a major chip hub on the lines of the United States, Taiwan and South Korea, and has been courting foreign companies to set up operations in the country. Previously, the country has approved a fabrication plant worth $11 billion being set up by Tata Electronics in partnership with Taiwan’s Powerchip, and three different chip assembly plants being set up by the Tatas, US-based Micron Technology, and Murugappa Group’s CG Power in partnership with Japan’s Renesas.

Currently, there are more proposals to set up semiconductor units with the government. This includes a Rs 78,000 crore fabrication plant proposed by Israel’s Tower Semiconductor, and a Rs 4,000 crore assembly plant by Zoho.

After having committed nearly all of the $10 billion in subsidies under its ambitious semiconductor manufacturing incentive policy, the government has prepared a blueprint for the second phase of the scheme — it could increase the outlay of the programme to $15 billion, offer capital support for raw materials and gases used in chip manufacturing, and reduce subsidies for assembly and testing plants, The Indian Express had earlier reported.

In an internal note prepared with the projections for the renewal of the scheme, the government has also decided to reduce the capex subsidy for assembly and testing plants (ATMP/OSAT) from the current 50 per cent to 30 per cent for conventional packaging technologies, and 40 per cent for advanced packaging technologies.

The government also does not want to support technology transfer costs under the new incentive scheme, it is understood. This means that companies partnering with others for using their chip manufacturing technology may have to pay out of their own pocket.

Under the new scheme, the government could also offer capital equipment and ecosystem support such as gases, chemicals, and raw materials needed at assembly and testing plants. It could also look at incentivising fabrication of micro-LED displays.

It is also learnt that Micron Technology’s ATMP plant in Gujarat’s Sanand is running 133 days behind schedule, due to the company’s inability to hire sufficient construction headcount. The Tatas have sought that the requirement for PSMC to demonstrate capability to manufacture 28 nanometre chips should be exempted for extending fiscal support for the node. The government is considering the company’s request, but has not come to a conclusion yet.

","The Union Cabinet has approved a Rs 3,300 crore semiconductor assembly and testing plant by Kaynes Semicon, marking the fifth semiconductor unit and fourth assembly unit to gain Cabinet approval under India’s Rs 76,000 crore chip manufacturing incentive scheme. The new plant, set to be built in Sanand, Gujarat, will produce 60 lakh chips daily for various applications including automotive, electric vehicles, and consumer electronics. Initially planned for Telangana, the plant’s relocation to Gujarat aligns with the region's growing cluster of chip assembly units. The government will provide approximately Rs 1,300 crore in subsidies.

India aims to become a major chip hub, paralleling leaders like the US and Taiwan, with several other semiconductor projects underway, including an $11 billion fabrication plant by Tata Electronics and various assembly plants. Future adjustments to the incentive scheme may include increased support for raw materials and reduced subsidies for assembly and testing plants, alongside potential support for micro-LED display fabrication.

Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro declared a state of calamity for the hardest-hit areas late on Tuesday, invoking powers to mobilise more firefighters and civil servants. He also called on police investigators to redouble their efforts to find those who started the fires and pledged help for those who have lost their homes or have been evacuated.

The hot, dry conditions behind the outbreaks in Portugal coincided this week with flooding in central Europe. The European Union said Wednesday that the juxtaposed extreme weather phenomena are proof of a “climate breakdown”.

Fellow European Union members Spain, France, Italy and Greece have committed two water-dropping aircraft each to help Portuguese firefighters.

Spain's military is also sending 240 soldiers and vehicles from its emergency response battalions specialised in combating fires across the border to its neighbour.

Montenegro made a special call for security forces to pursue both arsonists and any individuals who started a fire out of negligence. Portuguese national police said that they have arrested seven men suspected of having started wildfires in recent days. Authorities have prohibited the use of heavy farming equipment to reduce the risk of inadvertently starting a blaze.

Among the hardest hit areas is the district of Aveiro, south of the northern city of Porto, but several major blazes were also raging out of control in other wooded areas.

Authorities have yet to release figures for property damage or the number of evacuees, but Portuguese state broadcaster RTP has shown charred houses in rural villages and local residents trying to battle flames with buckets of water, hoses, and even large tree branches. Other televised images showed visibility reduced to a few metres as orange smoke enveloped the terrain.

Three firefighters died in their vehicle on Tuesday, while another had succumbed to what authorities called a “sudden illness” while on duty over the weekend. Three civilians have also perished, according to civil protection authorities.

Portugal was devasted by massive fires in 2017 that killed over 120 people.

Experts link the fires to both climate change and the abandonment of traditional farming and forestry professions that helped keep rural areas clear of underbrush that is now fuel for fires.","Northern Portugal is grappling with a severe wildfire crisis, with over 100 fires stretching emergency services thin and resulting in seven deaths.

Chandigarh, August 30

In a major embarrassment for the Haryana Police, the Punjab and Haryana High Court has asserted that investigation into cases of alleged drug trafficking in the State is being conducted in a “casual and cavalier manner.”
The assertion came as N.S. Shekhawat directed Gurugram Commissioner of Police to file a personal affidavit detailing all FIRs registered under the NDPS Act in all the police stations under his jurisdiction where the accused have not been arrested for over six months.

The directions came in a case where an accused in a drugs case was “roaming freely” and had not been arrested by the police even though the FIR in the matter was registered in July 2023 and the earlier anticipatory bail petition filed by him was withdrawn from the court in July this year.
“From the record, it is apparent that even after a lapse of more than one year, the accused in the present case is roaming freely and has not been arrested by the police. This clearly reflects that in a case where there are serious allegations of trafficking of drugs in the State of Haryana, the investigation is being conducted in a most casual and cavalier manner,” Justice Shekhawat asserted.

The matter was brought to Justice Shekhawat’s notice after the accused filed the petition for the grant anticipatory ball registered under the provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act at Bilaspur police station in Gurugram district.

Taking up the matter, Justice Shekhawat further directed that the affidavit should specify whether the accused in such cases had been declared proclaimed offenders and whether efforts had been made to attach their properties. Fixing the matter for further hearing on September 9, Justice Shekhawat made it clear that Gurugram Commissioner of Police was required to appear in person before the court, if the affidavit was not submitted by date fixed.

Justice Shekhawat added the Supreme Court had underscored the necessity for speedy investigation and trials, stressing that both were are mandated by the law and the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure/BNSS and constitutional protection enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of

India.

The court added the Supreme Court had clarified that the speedy trial as well as speedy investigation were an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article 21 of the Constitution of India.","The Punjab and Haryana High Court criticized the Haryana Police for conducting drug trafficking investigations in a ""casual and cavalier manner.""

Why startups should care about AI
For startups, AI represents an unparalleled opportunity for growth. Whether it’s automating processes, improving customer experience, or creating entirely new products, AI can help startups scale faster and more efficiently. However, understanding how to navigate the ethical, legal, and regulatory landscape is equally important.

That’s why India’s AI Edge track at the ET Soonicorns Summit  2024 is a must-attend for anyone in the startup ecosystem. It offers a comprehensive view of AI’s transformative potential while providing actionable insights into how you can use AI responsibly and effectively.              In her TED Talk titled ‘Empowering India’s Deep Tech & AI Landscape: Policies, Perspectives, and India-First Models for GenAI Growth,’ Bavi will explore India’s unique position in the AI ecosystem. Drawing on her expertise at Microsoft, she will shed light on how India can leverage AI’s transformative potential to create socio-economic impact at scale.

Bavi’s extensive experience with Microsoft’s AI strategy and digital transformation initiatives positions her as a thought leader in this space. Her insights into India’s approach to AI innovation—and its ambitious adoption of Generative AI (Gen AI)—will offer attendees a clear roadmap about India’s strides in AI through the lens of policy, perspective, and the development of indigenous Gen AI models.

This roundtable will explore one of the most pressing challenges facing the AI landscape today: deepfakes and inauthentic content. As AI becomes more pervasive, the ethical implications of its use—particularly in media, security, and social governance—become more complex.

With panellists who bring a wealth of experience in AI technology, innovation, and policy, the discussion will focus on India’s AI policy and its role in shaping global AI regulations:

Siddharth Bhardwaj, an expert in machine learning (ML) and audio technology, has pushed the envelope with Beatoven.ai, which applies AI to create personalised music. Armed with his technical expertise, Bhardwaj will shed light on how AI-driven content can be both beneficial and harmful;

With his mission to create AI solutions for billions of people, Soni brings a long-term perspective on AI’s role in addressing societal challenges, while navigating regulatory frameworks;
Sachin Malhan, the Co-founder of Agami, will focus on legal innovation and justice reform. His expertise will guide discussions on the legal and regulatory challenges that startups face in a fast-paced AI world, offering solutions to promote responsible AI use;
Disha Ravi, a climate justice activist, who was instrumental in setting up the Indian chapter of ‘Fridays for Future’—the global movement for climate justice founded by Greta Thunberg, a teen climate activist from Sweden. Ravi, who is also a crusader against fake news, will bring in-depth perspectives into the damaging phenomenon of misinformation and disinformation.

Together, these experts will offer a rich exploration of how startups can responsibly deploy AI to counter bias while ensuring compliance with India’s AI policies.
AI in India: Transformative potential and risks
India’s AI ecosystem is unique in its approach to balancing innovation with regulation. Over the past decade, the Indian government has actively encouraged AI-driven solutions for sectors like healthcare, agriculture, and finance. With applications ranging from disease detection to financial inclusion, India’s AI strategy holds significant promise for transforming key industries .
However, as with any disruptive technology, AI poses risks. Deepfakes, biased algorithms, and unauthorised data use are challenges that require urgent attention. India’s AI strategy must address these issues head-on, not just for ethical reasons, but to ensure the long-term sustainability of its AI ecosystem.

The Indian Express,2024-09-19 00:00:00,‘Indian students make long-term friendships’: Deputy Vice-Chancellor of University of Melbourne,"The University of Melbourne Tuesday inaugurated a global centre in New Delhi to enhance partnerships and engagement with local students, alumni, government officials, and educational partners.

The Melbourne Global Centre is not designed for teaching or as an offshore campus. It will act as a bridge between Indian students and Australia. The centre will house an official from the university who will be responsible for clearing all doubts that prospective Indian students might have related to admission to the University of Melbourne.

The varsity also shared news of developing talks with JNU about a joint PhD. However, the details are yet to be finalised.  Professor Michael Wesley, Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Global, Culture and Engagement), University of Melbourne talks to indianexpress.com about the varsity’s plans to open an offshore campus in India, the recent international student cap by the Australian government and more. Some excerpts from the interview…

Like the University of Wollongong and Deakin, is UoM also planning to launch an Indian campus, as per UGC’s new initiative?  The University of Melbourne has no plans to open a campus overseas or offshore. But what our global centre enables us to do is to expand our collaboration with Indian universities and expand the provision of education through existing Indian universities. With several Indian universities, we have been developing new ways of teaching, like Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Education, and other courses.

What is the university’s Stance on the Cap on international students?   The university opposes the cap, we think it is a bad policy, but we are not the only ones who think like that. There is a range of voices from within Australia — universities, business groups, economists, accommodation providers and tourism industry who say that it’s not a good policy. So, we are preparing to comply with it, but I am hoping that the cap will be a short run thing because the folly of this policy will become apparent to the government.

The cap on international students will have detrimental consequences for our University, the higher education sector generally, and the nation for years to come. The effects will be felt by students and staff, in terms of inadequate funding to teach and do research, and by industry partners, and there will also be negative effects on the broader economy.

Importantly, the proposed caps do not currently apply to our students already enrolled in our graduate degrees, or students currently studying an undergraduate degree at the University and who intend to progress directly to a graduate degree here.

What is the new global centre that has been launched today?  The University of Melbourne Global Centre is a multifunctional space located in New Delhi. The Global Centre allows to showcase the richness and diversity of what we do at the University of Melbourne to a broad section of Indian society. Whether it’s a guest lecture, symposia, professional development or student exchange, it provides us with the ability to engage constantly with Indian society, facilitating the exchange of ideas between India and Melbourne.

Which courses will this global centre offer, and how will the admissions and certifications take place? Would you provide placement as it is a common culture in the India varsities?

This centre is our physical presence in-country, but not a teaching campus. It will not offer any award teaching that results in university degrees, but it will offer non-award trainings like professional development or skill enhancement programmes for students. It will provide training to individuals aiming to upgrade their skills in particular areas for example, it could offer training to civil servants on various topics and methods. Additionally, it will facilitate student exchanges.

The University of Melbourne has no plans to open a campus overseas or offshore.

One of the most promising opportunities the global centre offers is the prospect of bringing the university of Melbourne students to Delhi and helping them connect with students from Indian universities to do joint projects and workshops. This will promote meaningful interactions between Australian and Indian students.  How has the Indian diaspora at Melbourne University changed over the years?

We value our Indians students, they invariably become deeply involved in campus life, student clubs and societies as well, as representative bodies. They are vibrant contributors to campus life. For how things have changed over the year, I think they have grown in number, and we would love to see more Indian students at the University of Melbourne. They socialise very well and make long-term friendships.

It is often said that finding accommodation in Australia is one of the toughest tasks for international students. Does Melbourne University provide on-campus accommodation, and/or support for finding places?

We have some on-campus accommodation at the university, but there’s a lot more off-campus accommodation, particularly purpose-built student accommodation and we certainly are prepared to help students to find accommodation.  There is no difficulty in finding accommodation in Melbourne. In fact, there is an oversupply of student accommodation in the city and we keep a very close eye on that. We are more than happy to help students find access to the appropriate accommodation.

Is Melbourne University planning to launch any new scholarships to attract Indian students?  We are working on some new scholarships to attract Indian students, and we hope to announce that in the coming months.","The University of Melbourne inaugurated its Global Centre in New Delhi to enhance engagement with Indian students, alumni, and educational partners. The centre will not function as a teaching campus but will provide assistance to prospective students regarding admissions and facilitate collaboration with Indian universities. Talks are ongoing with Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) for a potential joint PhD program.

Professor Michael Wesley, Deputy Vice-Chancellor, emphasized that the university has no plans to establish an offshore campus. Instead, the centre will support professional development and skill enhancement programs, while also facilitating student exchanges. 

Regarding Australia's recent cap on international students, Wesley expressed opposition, noting its negative impact on funding and the broader economy but hopes it will be a short-term measure. The Global Centre will showcase the university’s offerings and promote collaboration through joint projects and workshops between Australian and Indian students. 

Additionally, the university is developing new scholarships aimed at attracting more Indian students and will provide support for finding both on-campus and off-campus accommodation. The Indian student community at Melbourne is noted for its vibrant involvement in campus life.",Education,180,882

Business Standard,2024-11-28 00:00:00,Ajmer Dargah Sharif claimed as Shiva temple in new religious site dispute,"A Rajasthan court has accepted a petition alleging that the Ajmer Sharif Dargah is a Shiva temple. This development follows a recent court-mandated survey of the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh, which triggered protests and led to the deaths of five Muslims, including a minor, allegedly in police firing.

The petition was filed by Vishnu Gupta, leader of the right-wing Hindu Sena. Subsequently, an Ajmer lower court issued notices to three entities regarding claims of a Shiva temple within the premises of the revered shrine dedicated to Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.
 
Civil Judge Manmohan Chandel, presiding over the case, has sought responses from the Ajmer Dargah Committee, the Ministry of Minority Affairs, and the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Advocate Yogesh Siroja, representing the petitioner, stated that the notices were issued in connection with the lawsuit filed in September.
 
 
Call to declare Ajmer dargah as ‘Sankat Mochan Mahadev Temple’
 
The petitioner, Vishnu Gupta, demanded that the dargah be officially declared as the “Sankat Mochan Mahadev Temple.” He has also requested an ASI-led survey of the site to establish its historical and religious significance. Additionally, he called for the cancellation of all registrations associated with the dargah and the restoration of Hindu worship rights at the site.

Gupta’s plea stated: “Our demand is that the Ajmer dargah should be declared as the Sankat Mochan Mahadev Temple. If the dargah has any kind of registration, it should be cancelled. Its survey should be conducted by the ASI, and Hindus should be granted the right to worship there.”
 
The case is scheduled for its next hearing on December 20.
 
AAP MP calls for SC intervention
 
Reacting to the development, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MP Sanjay Singh urged the Supreme Court to intervene, citing the Places of Worship Act, 1991. Singh said, “The Act clearly states that religious structures must remain as they were on August 15, 1947. If such precedents of claiming temples beneath mosques or vice versa continue, it will lead to nationwide chaos. PM Modi and the BJP are fueling these conflicts, and I call them the Bharatiya Jhagda Party.”
 
What is the Places of Worship Act, 1991?
 
The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, was enacted to preserve the religious character of all places of worship as they existed on August 15, 1947. Introduced against the backdrop of communal tensions, the Act aims to prevent legal disputes and conversions of religious sites, ensuring a foundation for interfaith harmony.
 
The law prohibits the conversion of any place of worship, whether partial or complete, from one religion to another. It seeks to protect the sanctity and historical identity of such sites.
 
Section 4 mandates that the religious character of all places of worship remains as it was on August 15, 1947, reinforcing historical continuity and respect for diverse traditions.
 
The Act invalidates all legal cases concerning the conversion of religious sites arising before 1947 and prohibits the filing of fresh lawsuits on this matter. However, the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute was excluded from its purview, as it was already under judicial scrutiny when the Act was passed.
 
Which other mosques or monuments face such claims?
 
Religious conflicts involving mosques and dargahs have intensified, often leading to unrest.
 
• Gyanvapi mosque, Varanasi: Hindu groups claim the mosque was built atop a Hindu temple. A 2022 court-ordered survey led to disputes over a supposed shivling, which the Muslim community argued was a fountain.
 
• Shahi Idgah mosque, Mathura: Hindu groups assert that this mosque was built on a sacred Hindu site. The Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict in 2019 reignited these claims.
 
• Haji Malang dargah, Maharashtra: Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde’s claim that the dargah was originally a Hindu temple sparked renewed tensions.
 
• Sambhal Shahi Jama Masjid, Uttar Pradesh: A survey alleging the mosque was built on a Hindu temple led to violence, deaths, and government-imposed restrictions.
 
• Qutub Minar, Delhi: Hindu groups claim it was originally a temple complex referred to as the Vishnu Stambh. This theory gained traction after ASI officials suggested the site’s Hindu origins.","A Rajasthan court accepted a petition by Hindu Sena leader Vishnu Gupta, claiming that Ajmer Sharif Dargah is a Shiva temple.

The Hindu,2024-08-25 00:00:00,Erik Ten Hag faces scrutiny after United loss while Haaland nets hat trick and Arsenal beats Aston Villa,"
Two games into the Premier League season, and the scrutiny is already back on Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag.

Joao Pedro scored in the fifth minute of injury time to give Brighton a 2-1 home win over United on Saturday (August 24) in a game that showed that the inconsistencies that plagued Ten Hag's team last season still haven't been eradicated.

After United failed to clear a corner, Pedro headed home a cross from Simon Adingra to secure a second straight victory for Brighton at the start of its first season under 31-year-old coach Fabian Hurzeler.

The two leading title rivals also made it two wins out of two with shows of strength.

Erling Haaland scored his seventh Premier League hat trick in Manchester City's 4-1 win over Ipswich, while Arsenal earned a 2-0 win at Aston Villa — a team it lost to twice last season before losing the title by two points to City.

Like Ten Hag, Sean Dyche could also be feeling the early pressure after his Everton side slumped to another heavy defeat, losing 4-0 at Tottenham.

Also Saturday, West Ham beat Crystal Palace 2-0 away, Fulham earned a 2-1 home win over Leicester and Nottingham Forest won 1-0 at Southampton.

The defeat at Brighton will be extra tough for United to take as the visitors had a potential winner ruled out in the 70th minute for an almost comical offside.

Alejandro Garnacho’s shot from a tight angle was heading into an empty net when it deflected off the knee of the sliding Joshua Zirkzee just before it crossed the line – causing the goal to be ruled out as the Dutch striker was in an offside position.

“We thought we scored the winning goal, and it’s so bad luck that the ball is on the line,” said Ten Hag, the Dutch manager who was under heavy pressure last season but was retained by United after leading the team to the FA Cup title.

The discussion about whether he is the right man to lead United will probably be rekindled after a loss that was the result of both missed chances and poor defending.

“You can’t drop points so unnecessarily,” Ten Hag said. “If you protect the goal like we do, you drop points.”

Former United striker Danny Welbeck gave Brighton the lead in the 32nd before Amad Diallo equalized on a counterattack in the 60th when he cut in from the right and saw his shot deflected into the net by the sliding Jan Paul van Hecke.

For a brief moment, it looked like promoted Ipswich might pull off a major upset after new signing Sammie Szmodics put the visitors ahead early against Man City.

But three goals in less than four minutes quickly restored order at the Etihad Stadium.

Haaland equalized with a penalty in the 12th minute and made it 3-1 in the 16th after running onto a perfect ball over the top from Kevin De Bruyne and going around goalkeeper Arijanet Muric. De Bruyne had scored the second into an empty net after Man City winger Savinho robbed Muric of the ball, and Haaland completed his hat trick from outside the area in the 88th.

Haaland now has four goals in two games after netting the opener in a 2-0 win over Chelsea last weekend.

Unai Emery was largely responsible for his former team missing out on the title last season, especially as Villa's 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium proved decisive in the title race. Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta turned the tables this time, though. Arteta sent on Leandro Trossard in the 65th minute and the winger scored with his first touch two minutes later after Bukayo Saka's low cross was deflected into his path. Saka then set up Thomas Partey for the second in the 77th.

Villa striker Ollie Watkins missed two great chances to give his team the lead — shooting wide in the first half after Arsenal turned the ball over, and then seeing goalkeeper David Raya pull off a spectacular one-handed save to stop his diving header in the second. Raya had scrambled to divert a deflected long-range shot that ended up hitting the crossbar but managed to get off the ground quickly to claw away Watkins' header from the rebound.

“I’m on the floor so I try to get up and I can’t reach it,” Raya said. “I just see Ollie going in there so I react as quickly as possible.”

Everton might be heading for another relegation fight unless Dyche can shore up his defense quickly.

Everton was under pressure throughout at Tottenham in a game where the scoreline easily could have been even bigger. Everton was beaten 3-0 at home by Brighton in its opening game, and the team's last season at Goodison Park could be a difficult one.

Yves Bissouma opened the scoring in the 14th minute with a strike from the edge of the area that went in off the underside of the crossbar. Bissouma was suspended by the club for its opening 1-1 draw at Leicester last weekend after uploading a video to social media of himself inhaling laughing gas. But he was back in the starting lineup, and thanked manager Ange Postecoglou by running up to the Australian and giving him a hug after his goal.

Son Heung-min scored twice for Spurs, while Cristian Romero added the other with a header from a corner.

West Ham’s Tomas Soucek and Jarrod Bowen had to cut short their goal celebrations against Palace to pull a ball boy out from underneath an advertising screen that collapsed.

Soucek had just scored the opening goal in the 67th minute and Bowen jumped onto his back as they celebrated in front of the away fans at Selhurst Park. But some of those supporters spilled onto the field when the advertising hoardings gave way, and a ball boy was left trapped underneath one of the screens.

Soucek then quickly hoisted the screen up while Bowen helped the boy to his feet and made sure he was unharmed.","The Premier League's early season drama continues as Manchester United’s Erik ten Hag faces renewed scrutiny following a 2-1 defeat to Brighton. Joao Pedro’s injury-time header clinched Brighton's win, extending United's inconsistency from last season. United had a goal disallowed and struggled defensively, leading to calls for Ten Hag’s review.

Meanwhile, Manchester City maintained their strong start with a 4-1 victory over Ipswich Town, with Erling Haaland scoring a hat-trick. Arsenal also secured a 2-0 win against Aston Villa, thanks to goals from Leandro Trossard and Thomas Partey, overturning last season's defeats to Villa.

Everton’s struggles continued as they were thrashed 4-0 by Tottenham, putting Sean Dyche under pressure. West Ham had a more positive day with a 2-0 win over Crystal Palace, though celebrations were briefly interrupted by a collapsed advertising board.

Other notable results include Fulham’s 2-1 victory over Leicester and Nottingham Forest’s 1-0 win at Southampton.",Sports,149,1011

Both companies have faced challenges in keeping pace with industry leaders like Tesla and emerging Chinese manufacturers. A merger could position them as the world's third-largest automaker by sales, potentially leading to cost reductions and a stronger market presence.However, the proposed merger faces significant obstacles. Former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has expressed skepticism, describing the move as a sign of ""panic"" and doubting its success due to insufficient synergies between the companies. He argues that both automakers have similar strengths and weaknesses, leading to industrial duplication rather than complementary benefits.Additionally, both companies are currently engaged in their own strategic initiatives and partnerships, which could complicate merger efforts. Nissan has been seeking new shareholders due to its strained relationship with Renault, and Honda has been independently investing in electric vehicles. The time and resources required to navigate these complexities may be more than either company can afford amidst the pressing demands of the EV market.","Honda and Nissan are considering a merger to better compete in the electric vehicle market, aiming to become the world's third-largest automaker.

Indian Express,2024-12-29 00:00:00,"My Diary 2024: Sreeja Akula — ‘Don’t want one Olympics match to become my identity, 2024 has been my best year","India’s top table tennis player says the Round of 16 defeat to World No. 1 Sun Yingsha at Paris 2024 won’t define her and vows to build on a successful year.As a hectic year of sports gallops to the finish line, India’s top athletes pause and reflect; tell the stories of their podium highs, battered bodies and shattered dreams. In a special series, some look back with fondness, a few others with regrets. But all with the hope – and wish – of a better 2025.

From the time ‘that’ match ended, I keep getting asked the same thing a lot. Yes, I was leading 10-6 and 10-5 in the first two games of the Paris Olympics Round-of-16 match against the World No. 1 from China, Sun Yingsha. And yet, I lost the match.

I don’t want it to become my identity.

Honestly, no, I wasn’t over-thinking or anything. There’s no time for that in table tennis. She (Yingsha) just raised her game and went on an all-out attack. I didn’t expect that. Looking back, I should’ve focused more on myself and taken a few risks. I was too passive and that’s why perhaps I couldn’t convert those points.

But after all, that’s sport.

The entire Olympic experience was surreal. When I entered the Village, I was glad to make my dream come true. But I didn’t just want to participate. I wanted to make a mark. I wanted to record a few good upsets.

I went with that kind of mindset and when the singles started, everybody was telling me that the Olympics is something different, once you get into the arena your hands will be cold and you have to overcome all that.

However, when I went into the arena I felt as if it was just another tournament. I felt okay, this was the Olympics but it was the same opponents I had been seeing in other tournaments, it was the same table, the same ball. So, I decided to keep everything away and focus on the ball, focus on my game, and that worked really well.

I played every match as if that was going to be the last of my career. When I saw the draw and knew that I would have to face Sun Yingsha, I wasn’t scared. I was in a great rhythm. I was focusing on my technique, my strokes, and what I had to play rather than what she was going to do. Okay, I knew she was World No. 1. She was going to play some extraordinary shots. I was well prepared for all that and I kept telling myself that I too have worked as hard as she did. Technically and even mentally I was at my peak.

Yeah, I would’ve liked to win those games. And who knows what might’ve happened but I can’t sit back and feel sorry for myself. I surpassed all expectations this year.

I have to admit that 2024 was the best year of my career, it was a year full of milestones. And it started with a leap of faith.

Who would’ve thought that deciding to travel halfway around the world to play a WTT Feeder in Corpus Christi would have had so much impact on my career? That feeder title set the tone for a stellar year in which I won another Feeder in Beirut before winning the Lagos Contender before the Olympics.

People have asked me what I’ve done differently but honestly, it was not something I did in this particular year. It was the hard work and effort I’ve put in over a period of time. And it showed up at the right time.

I have to credit my coach Somnath Ghosh, my parents, my mental and physical trainer, my support team at Go Sports and of course my sponsors. It’s their success as much as mine.

I went to Corpus Christi out of desperation. I just wanted to win matches at the international level because in the last two years, I was winning hardly one or two matches and barely even qualifying for the main draw. Mentally it was getting very difficult for me because I wanted to do well, I wanted to win good matches.

I did not have any such expectations at the start of the year but I always wanted to play in the Olympics. I always wanted to be in the top 20, top 30 of the world rankings. That was my aim but I did not expect to come, I did not expect everything to come in one year.

Immediately after the Olympics, I faced my real big challenge. I suffered an injury that forced me to take a break. I felt it in Paris but the high of the event didn’t let it bother my game.


In a way, the injury was a blessing as it allowed me to rest both physically and mentally. I could just reflect on what I have done all these years, the way I prepared, the way I played. I could watch good videos, I had some time off to do different things. I did some drawing, I love to draw, and it’s the only hobby I have. Finding time to do it felt great.

All that helped me a lot but it was again difficult to get back to the game because I lost a bit of strength while recovering from the injury.

But I’m back now. And though 2025 isn’t an Olympic year, I want to start it the same way I started 2024. I’ve reached the top-25 of World rankings and this year is going to be about pushing harder. Top-20, Top-15, higher? Anything is possible.

The free press journal,2024-08-03 00:00:00,Navi Mumbai: Vegetable Prices Soar In APMC Market Due To Heavy Rains And Supply Shortage,"Shortage of supply due to incessant rains across the state has led to increase in vegetable prices in the APMC market. While onions are being sold at Rs 45 to Rs 50 per kg in the retail market, tomatoes are being sold at Rs 60 to Rs 80 per kg. Traders attribute the surge in price due to decrease in inbound vehicles.

""Currently, close to 630 trucks carrying vegetables are coming in the APMC market which, in normal case, is close to 1000 trucks. This is due to heavy showers across the state,"" vegetable trader Kailas Tajne said.

Another trader said that the bad condition of roads in many parts of the state might be the reason for lesser number of vehicles arriving in the market.

Asked about increase in prices of garlic, a trader from Onion Potato market said there is shortage of the produce coming in market for the past two years. ""Normally, we face shortage of supplies during this period every year. This year, however, rains further affected the supply leading to the prices on a higher side,"" he added.

""No vegetable is available below Rs 100 per kg. Ladies finger is being sold at Rs 5000 per 100 kg in the wholesale market while French Beans are being sold at Rs 7,000 per 100 kg. Similarly, Cluster Beans are available for Rs 7,000 per 100 kg, Common Beans (ghevda) is being sold at Rs 60 per kg and Green Potato is available at Rs 55 per kg,"" Tajne said.","The persistent rains across the state have caused a significant rise in vegetable prices at the APMC market due to a shortage in supply. Onions are currently being sold at ₹45 to ₹50 per kg, while tomatoes are priced at ₹60 to ₹80 per kg in the retail market. This price surge is attributed to the reduced number of inbound trucks, with only 630 trucks arriving instead of the usual 1000, as explained by vegetable trader Kailas Tajne. Poor road conditions due to the rains are further hindering transportation.

The garlic market is experiencing a similar shortage, which has persisted for the past two years, leading to higher prices. No vegetable is available for less than ₹100 per kg.

Indian Express,2024-12-26 00:00:00,Need to counter Congress on Ambedkar: BJP to allies; TDP for Opposition-like coordination,"Members of the ruling NDA met Wednesday at the New Delhi residence of BJP president and Union Minister J P Nadda to discuss ways to put up a united front to counter the Opposition “narrative” on the issue of the Constitution and Dr B R Ambedkar.

The TDP, a key partner of the BJP, underlined the need for better NDA coordination on the lines of what the INDIA bloc has been doing to attack the government and the ruling alliance, especially after Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s remark in Rajya Sabha which the Congress claimed was an “insult” of Ambedkar.



Hours after paying tribute to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his 100th birth anniversary, NDA leaders met at Nadda’s house for almost an hour. Sources said the leaders discussed the Opposition onslaught against the BJP over Shah’s remark, caste census and social justice politics.

Shah was said to have told the leaders, including TDP leader and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, that the Congress was trying to create “false narratives”.

The TDP, sources said, was also of the view that the Opposition was peddling a “false narrative”. The message was clear: the NDA will have to counter the Opposition narrative unitedly, and there was need for coordination among the partners.

Sources said that BJP leaders targeted the Congress for making Shah’s remark on Ambedkar “an issue” to “mislead” the public.

“In the meeting, we were told how the Congress MPs did not react when Shah, in his speech in Rajya Sabha, made the remark. But later, Congress leaders held a meeting where Rahul Gandhi was present and they decided to make the remark an issue to be highlighted. So, Congress conspired to make Shah’s comment an issue to only draw attention,” a leader familiar with the discussions said.

The BJP leaders, including senior Union Ministers, also told NDA members about the “misdeeds” of past Congress governments like “insulting Ambedkar” and imposing Emergency.

The BJP called upon NDA allies to “expose” the Congress on the ground and tell people what the BJP-led NDA government has done to respect the memory of Ambedkar – like developing Panch Tirths (five places of pilgrimage) – and for the “empowerment” of Dalits by giving them their due share in welfare schemes.

After the meeting, leaders of BJP allies, sources said, also met Nadda individually and discussed issues related to their respective agenda and states.

Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde were not present at the meeting.

The leaders who attended were said to have expressed happiness over the NDA’s victories in the Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections, months after a slight dip in the alliance tally in the Lok Sabha elections.

The JD(U) was represented by Union Minister Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh and the Shiv Sena by Union MoS Prataprao Ganpatrao Jadhav. Also in attendance were Union Minister and JD (S) leader H D Kumaraswamy, Civil Aviation Minister and TDP leader K Rammohan Naidu, former Union Minister Upendra Kushwaha and Union Ministers Anupriya Patel, Jitan Ram Manjhi and Sanjay Nishad.

Sources said Shah spoke at length on recent political developments, including what transpired during the winter session of Parliament and the learnings from it. He told the leaders that the Congress never respected Ambedkar but was now trying to create a narrative in its favour, which should be countered forcefully and unitedly.

The NDA meeting took place a day before the extended meeting of the Congress Working Committee in Belagavi where it is set to mount a fresh offensive against the BJP over the issues of Ambedkar and caste census. The Congress meet will be followed by a public rally that has been named Jai Bapu, Jai Bhim, Jai Samvidhan rally – apart from marking 100 years of Mahatma Gandhi’s presidency of the Congress in 1924, the Congress intends to corner the BJP and NDA over Ambedkar and the Constitution.","Members of the ruling NDA met to discuss a united strategy to counter the Opposition's narrative on issues related to the Constitution and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, particularly following Union Minister Amit Shah's controversial remark in the Rajya Sabha. The NDA leaders, including BJP and TDP officials, emphasized the need for better coordination among alliance partners to challenge Congress's portrayal of Shah's comment. The meeting highlighted past Congress actions against Ambedkar and called for a united response to expose Congress’s “false narratives.” The discussions came ahead of the Congress Working Committee's extended meeting and rally focused on Ambedkar and social justice issues.",Politics,101,656

Nag Ashwin’s Kalki 2898 AD was released on June 27 this year. The film, starring Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan and Kamal Haasan built on the lore of Ashwatthama and Kali Yug. In an interview with So South, production designer Nitin Zihani Choudary revealed some interesting details about the film and its sequel. (Also Read: Nag Ashwin answers 5 burning questions about Kalki 2898 AD and its sequel)

Kamal Haasan plays Supreme Yaskin in Kalki 2898 AD.
There are 7 Complexes in the world
Kalki 2898 AD shows the Complex (an inverted pyramid structure with ample resources) led by Kamal’s Supreme Yaskin, situated in Kashi. Nitin revealed that there are 6 more such Complexes in Africa, Europe, America and other places. He also stated that all the Complexes are led by their own Yaskin.

Supreme Yaskin is not Kali per se
While many thought that Supreme Yaskin might be the personification of Kali, Nithin claimed that he was not Kali. He and the other Yaskins, in fact, report to Kali. The production designer also claimed that while the filmmakers haven’t figured out Kali’s appearance yet, ‘maybe he’s just a projection of Yaskin; he’s very abstract,’ he concluded.

The ending hints at this
Many have tried their best to decode the ending of Kalki 2898 AD, which is when Supreme Yaskin lifts a Brahmastra and recites a poem by Sri Sri. Nitin now claims that the idea behind the sage and oppressor was to make him like a ‘fallen god’. “It’s a negative shade of Krishna, the opposite of Him. You see similarities between them, and the ending hints at that,” said Nitin.

Rotting from the inside
Supreme Yaskin’s body has cracks all over it that glow from the inside. He also breathes with the help of pipes plugged into his body. Nitin called the character ‘old, fragile, rotten inside, yet powerful’. He also stated that the enlightenment Yaskin gains is on the ‘inside’ because, outside, ‘he’s just a shell’.

The world is upside down in Kalki 2898 AD
Usually, positive forces in mythology are expected to live in the heavens, while the negative ones live underground. But because it’s Kali Yug, Nitin explained that the world is upside down now. “You have a potent statue lifting the bad guys to heaven while the demigods like Ashwatthama live underground,” he said.","In a recent interview, production designer Nitin Zihani Choudary shared insights about Nag Ashwin's film ""Kalki 2898 AD."" Released on June 27, the film stars Prabhas, Deepika Padukone, Amitabh Bachchan, and Kamal Haasan, and is set in a futuristic world built on the lore of Ashwatthama and Kali Yug. Kamal Haasan plays Supreme Yaskin, who leads a resource-rich, inverted pyramid structure called the Complex in Kashi. There are six more such Complexes worldwide, each led by a Yaskin who reports to Kali. Supreme Yaskin, though not Kali, is depicted as a 'fallen god' with a negative shade akin to Krishna.

Borah made the statement after around 150 youths joined the Congress party during an event at Rajiv Bhawan in Guwahati. During the event, Borah said, ""What the Assam government has done to save the economy is really worrying. The government took loans and is now in debt of crores of rupees. They have increased the price of medicines, increased electricity bills, and sold tea gardens.

He contrasts this with the media's focus on Sarma’s public appearances, suggesting a disconnect between the government's priorities and the realities faced by the people.By highlighting the recruitment of young people into the Congress party, Borah aims to underscore a revitalization of the party and its appeal to the younger generation, while also framing the Congress as a viable alternative to the current administration.

The Tribune,2024-08-10 00:00:00,Supreme Court issues contempt notice to senior SBI official,"New Delhi, August 10

The Supreme Court has issued a contempt of court notice to a senior SBI official for failing to comply with its order to offer a One Time Settlement (OTS) to a Himachal Pradesh business firm operating from Chandigarh with regard to adjustment of subsidy amount towards repayment of interest and instalments of loan.

A Bench led by Justice Vikram Nath asked the of SBI Managing Director, Risk Compliance & Stressed Assets Resolution Group, Nariman Point, Mumbai and SBI Ludhiana Deputy General Manager Pradeep Pandhi to be present before it on August 20 for framing of charges against them for his failure to comply with its September 30, 2021 order.

“Prima facie, we are satisfied that a case for contempt is made out. Issue notice to alleged contemnor/respondent No. 2, i.e. Mr. Swaminathan J, Managing Director, Risk Compliance & Stressed Assets Resolution Group, State Bank of India. List this case on 20.08.2024 for framing of charges,” the Bench – which also included Justice PB Varale – said in its August 6 order.

The Bench, however, clarified that “if the alleged contemnor(s)/ respondent(s), who are presently named in the contempt petition, are not holding the said post(s), in that case, the person(s) holding the said post(s) presently will remain present in the Court on 20.08.2024.”

The top court said, “In the meantime, it is open for the respondents to purge the contempt petition, if they so desire.”

The order came after senior counsel PS Patwalia submitted on behalf of AB Refer Warehousing Pvt Ltd that the SBI officials failed to implement the top court’s September 30, 2021, order to offer an OTS to the Chandigarh-based business firm with regard to adjustment of subsidy amount towards repayment of interest and instalments of loan.

The firm had written to the SBI on October 5, 2021, to accept and process the OTS in terms of the top court’s order; adjust Rs 10.50 crore from the subsidy reserve fund lying with it and refund the balance amount of Rs 4.73 crore in full and final settlement of all dues.

However, instead of complying with the top court’s order, the SBI sought to reserve the subsidy amount fund of Rs 14.66 crore NPA dues and made a new OTS demand of Rs 9.08 crore for final settlement of dues. The petitioner contended that it was ex-facie contrary to November 13, 2020, OTS which the top court had ordered the bank to comply with.","On August 10, the Supreme Court issued a contempt of court notice to senior officials of the State Bank of India (SBI) for failing to comply with its order regarding a One Time Settlement (OTS) for a Himachal Pradesh business firm. The Court's order, issued on September 30, 2021, directed SBI to adjust subsidy amounts towards loan repayments for AB Refer Warehousing Pvt Ltd, but the bank did not follow through. 

The Court has summoned SBI Managing Director Swaminathan J and SBI Ludhiana Deputy General Manager Pradeep Pandhi to appear on August 20 to face charges. The Court clarified that if these officials are no longer in their positions, their successors should appear instead. The SBI's failure to comply led to a new OTS demand, which was deemed contrary to the earlier order. The firm had requested SBI to process the OTS and adjust the subsidy fund as per the Supreme Court's directions.",Crime and Justice,153,410

Sindhu had claimed a silver and bronze medal at the last two Olympics at Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo and will be heading into Paris with the aim of becoming the first Indian to win three Olympic medals.

“It is challenging, it’s not easy but, at the same time, it’s not impossible,” Sindhu said during an interaction conducted by Sports Authority of India, the Indian Olympic Association and the Badminton Association of India.

“Going into the third Olympics, I need to be smarter. I have a lot of experience on my side and I need to be much more smarter and I hope I can change the colour, and of course, get another medal for the country.”

Sindhu is currently training at the Hermann-Neuberger Sportschule in Saarbrucken, Germany after her proposal was cleared by the sports ministry. She will be heading to Paris directly from there when the Games begin on July 26.

“... Physically and mentally I am right there, I just have to be smarter and my coach Agus (Dwi Santoso) has been taking care of that, my trainer has been taking care of my physical part.

“I am working on all the strokes, whether it is defense, or attack or netplay, it is important to be perfect in all things.

“So I’m not focussing on just one stroke or technique, because you never know what it is going to be, there are players who are smart enough to change and move to plan B.

“So you need to be prepared for it and I am focusing on practicing each and everything to make everything perfect -- each stroke, all techniques.”

Asked why she picked Germany as her training base ahead of the Games, Sindhu said: “Prakash (Padukone) sir, and we all discussed and thought, it will be a good place, it is near to Paris, it is in between nowhere, so I am much more focussed.

“I have taken few sparring partners and have a team and currently training here has been very peaceful. I can focus even more before the Olympics.”

Sindhu has spent most time on the court in the run-up to the Olympics but she hasn’t been consistent enough or beating the top players. The Indian, though, did manage a runner-up finish at Malaysia Masters super 500.","Two-time Olympic medallist P V Sindhu is in peak physical and mental condition but acknowledges the need to be ""much smarter"" to win a third Olympic medal at the Paris Games.

The Arunachal Times ,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"APSSB sets new date for those who missed PST, PET","ITANAGAR, 29 Jun: The Arunachal Pradesh Staff Selection Board (APSSB) on Thursday set a new examination date for the candidates who missed the physical standard test (PST) and the physical efficiency test (PET) for the posts of head constable(RT), head constable (telecom), head constable driver (male), and constable driver (male).

A notification issued on Thursday by APSSB Secretary D Varma stated that the candidates who downloaded their admit card but could not appear for the PST and the PET on the scheduled date and time due to any reason are allowed to appear for the tests at the Police Training Centre (PTC) in Banderdewa.

The notification allows candidates – particularly those who downloaded the admit card but could not appear for the tests; those whose admit cards did not mention one of the applied post codes; and those who applied separately for multiple posts and were issued separate admit cards but did not carry the cards on the day of the tests – to appear for the tests.

The rescheduled examination date for the candidates who missed the PST/PET is 3 July. The reporting time is 6:30 am and the gates will be closed by 8:30 am.

Earlier, the PST and the PET for the posts of constables and drivers were held from 6-24 June.

The advertisement for these posts had been floated on 21 January, 2020. The APSSB conducted the tests for the posts more than four years after the floating of the advertisement.

The APSSB secretary refused to speak to the media.

Meanwhile, the candidates who appeared for the tests expressed dissatisfaction over the notification,  and questioned the APSSB whether it would reconduct the tests if the candidates fail again to appear for the tests.

“Despite the rain, we appeared for the tests, waking up early in the morning. It would be very unfair to us if the examination is reconducted,” said a candidate.

Meanwhile, the APSSB secretary issued a corrigendum on Saturday regarding

 the examination, stating that “those candidates who have downloaded the admit card and reported at PTC Banderdewa for the PST/PET but could not participate in the PST/PET on the scheduled date due to post code discrepancy in the admit card are allowed for the PST/PET.”

It said also that “the candidates who reported to the PTC and could not participate in the PST/PET because any one of the applied post code was not mentioned in the schedule on their admit cards” can take the tests on 3 July.

The corrigendum added that “the candidates who applied separately for posts and were issued separate admit cards and had reported at PTC Banderdewa but did not carry the respective admit cards on the day of the scheduled examination” are eligible for the fresh tests.

The APSSB further clarified that “the abovementioned three categories are allowed to appear for the PST/PET.”

It was a moment that was so unlike Dravid, who hardly gave a quote that could fire up the imagination of the headline desk, but remained committed to his job in a rather Gary Kirsten way.

 It's not what we did today but what we did for past 3-4 years: Rohit Sharma after win over South Africa

But that minimalism can never mask the challenges Dravid had to tame during his draining, overwhelming close to three years shepherding the most followed cricket team on this planet.

In fact, the scrutiny of Dravid began even before his appointment as the head coach. He was projected as the 'Next One' while guiding India during a short white ball series against Sri Lanka in mid-2021.

It was his audition -- a real-time interview to see how he would cope with the demands of a high-pressure post -- before he landed the job full-time in November that year.

From the outset, Dravid -- fair or unfair -- had to match up to the lofty legacy of his predecessor Ravi Shastri, under whom India had a fine run including back-to-back away series win in Australia, the Holy Grail of Test cricket for teams from the sub-continent.

While Dravid never got a chance to tour Down Under as a coach, he tamed the Antipodeans at home in different formats.

But a defeat and a drawn Test series against a 'weaker' South African side will rankle Dravid, for whom wins away from home always stood as the gold standard.

These are the routine obstacles that are endured by any coach. But Dravid had to face harsher tests which were unique to the Indian cricketing culture.

He was managing a dressing room full of superstars, an environment he was not very unfamiliar with from his playing days.

 From President Murmu to Rahul Gandhi, leaders extend heartiest congratulations to Team India after World Cup triumph

And he was well aware that even the slightest discord would be blown out of proportions.

Rewind to the exit saga of Anil Kumble's tenure and eventual ouster.

But Dravid had this priceless ability to gauge people and situations, and he channelised that into his coaching stint.

He put in place his methods without trying to dismantle the existing system, creating a balanced atmosphere with captain Rohit Sharma for players to excel.

Mohammed Siraj is a telling example. The pacer began his journey during the regime of Shastri, but flowered into an all-format bowler under the tutelage of Dravid.

However, he did not always have calm seas to navigate.

To begin with, three frontline batters -- Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane and Cheteshwar Pujara -- were gradually slipping out of the hot zone.

Kohli, who was always going to get the longer end of the rope, made Dravid's job easier, regaining some of his scoring ways but the other two reached their sell-by date as top-flight batters.

Their failure to deliver in the World Test Championship final against Australia in London last year hastened their walk towards the exit gate.

But Pujara and Rahane were the bulwarks of the Indian middle-order for long and the transition process had to be delicately dealt with.

Here Dravid leaned on his immense experience of working with players during the 'A' tours and other such developmental stages.

Realising the enormity of his task early, Dravid handed Shreyas Iyer a debut in his first Test series as coach -- against New Zealand at home.

 Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli announce retirement from T20Is after India’s World Cup win over South Africa

Iyer did not disappoint him either, making a hundred. Ironically, Iyer along with Ishan Kishan, two cricketers in whom Dravid invested heavily, were in the eye of a storm later, eventually leading to the duo missing a BCCI central contract.

Oddities apart, Dravid's way was not really flawed, and he extended it to the ODIs too, where he focused on building a wider pool of young players.

It was a trait Dravid developed from his captaincy days when the Bengaluru man and then coach Greg Chappell tried out several young players like Suresh Raina, Y Venugopala Rao, and Rudra Pratap Singh with varying degree of success.

Dravid adopted a similar strategy alongside Rohit, pushing forward talents like Shubman Gill, Kishan, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Siraj and Suryakumar Yadav, who had to wait for consistent chances under the previous dispensation.

They vindicated the faith placed on them while carrying India to the Asia Cup title in Sri Lanka last year, where Gill and Siraj topped India's batting and bowling charts respectively.

However, in the deepest corners of his mind Dravid will rue the missed chance of winning the 50-over World Cup at home after his side succumbed to Australia in the final.

The World Cup win at Barbados might have eased that pain considerably, but it, surprisingly, came in a format where Dravid, much against his schtick, largely followed the conventional path.

This is not to say that Dravid was out of sync with this format as demonstrated on Saturday.

So, how will Dravid's coaching stint be remembered? The World Cup victory will certainly occupy a large chunk of the public memory space.

However, above that, the flawless handling of a team of high-profile individuals will be the legacy for his successor to live up to. It's daunting too.

","Rahul Dravid's tenure as India's head coach culminated with a triumphant T20 World Cup victory, marking a case study in balanced and understated coaching. Despite his typically composed demeanor, Dravid displayed rare emotion upon winning the title, underscoring the challenges he faced managing a team of cricketing superstars amidst high expectations. His legacy includes nurturing young talent like Mohammed Siraj and overseeing a transition phase for seasoned players like Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, and Cheteshwar Pujara. Dravid's success in building team cohesion and guiding India to significant victories will define his coaching legacy, overshadowing occasional controversies and near misses in other formats.",Sports,102,995
Navhind times,2024-07-10 00:00:00,Mumbai BMW case: Main accused held after 2 days,"Mumbai: Mihir Shah, the absconding accused in the BMW hit-and-run case and son of a Shiv Sena politician, was arrested on Tuesday by Mumbai police, two days after he allegedly rammed his luxury car into a two-wheeler, killing a woman and injuring her husband.

Mihir, 24, who managed to evade the police since Sunday morning, was arrested from Virar near Mumbai, a senior police official said.

Mihir’s mother and two sisters were brought to Mumbai for questioning from Shahapur in Thane district.

They are being quizzed along with ten others, the official said.

The police stated that Mihir Shah’s politician father Rajesh Shah actively ensured his son’s escape and had plans to tow away the BMW car after the accident.

In a related development, the state excise department has sealed a bar in the Juhu area of Mumbai visited by Mihir and his friends on Saturday night, hours before he allegedly took the wheel of the car involved in the crash, an official said.

The bar manager had served hard liquor to Mihir, who is yet to complete 24 years of age, violating Maharashtra’s legal drinking age of 25, he said.

The action to seal the bar was taken on the orders of the district collector for violation of rules, the excise department official said.

Preliminary investigations showed that the luxury car driven by Mihir rammed into a two-wheeler from behind in the Worli area on Sunday morning, resulting in the death of Kaveri Nakhwa (45), who was riding pillion, while her husband Pradeep survived with injuries.

Kaveri Nakhwa was dragged for around 1.5 km by the speeding car before Mihir pulled it over, swapped the seat with his driver, and fled in another vehicle, according to police.

Following the crash, Mumbai police formed 11 teams and enlisted the Crime Branch to apprehend Mihir. A Look Out Circular (LOC) had also been issued against him, the official said.

A Mumbai court on Tuesday extended until July 11 the police custody of Rajesh Shah’s driver, Rajrishi Bidawat, in the hit-and-run case. Bidawat was sitting in the luxury car with Mihir at the time of the crash. Rajesh Shah is currently out on bail.

Chilling details of the accident emerged in CCTV footage produced by police in the court on Monday.

The footage shows Kaveri Nakhwa being dragged by the BMW car for 1.5 km before the car stopped. Mihir and Bidawat pulled the woman off the bonnet, placed her on the road, and swapped seats. While reversing the car, Bidawat ran over the victim before fleeing.

“After she was dragged from Worli, Mihir and Bidawat stopped the car just before BWSL and removed the woman who had got entangled in the vehicle’s tyre. Bidawat then took the driver’s seat and ran the car over the victim while reversing. They then fled,” an official said.

Earlier, the opposition had slammed the Maharashtra government over the rise in hit-and-run accidents in the state. Questions were also raised over the alleged delay in the arrest of Mihir even more than 48 hours had passed after the accident.","Mihir Shah, the accused in the BMW hit-and-run case in Mumbai, was finally arrested after evading police for several days. The incident occurred when Mihir allegedly crashed his luxury car into a two-wheeler in Worli, resulting in the death of Kaveri Nakhwa and injuring her husband, Pradeep. The aftermath of the incident revealed shocking details, including Mihir attempting to evade capture by swapping seats with his driver and fleeing in another vehicle.

The arrest was a result of intensive efforts by the Mumbai police, involving 11 teams and the Crime Branch, aided by a Look Out Circular (LOC) against Mihir. The police also brought in Mihir's mother, sisters, and others for questioning regarding their involvement or knowledge of his escape.

In a related development, a bar in Mumbai's Juhu area, where Mihir and his friends allegedly drank hours before the accident, was sealed by the state excise department for serving liquor to Mihir, who was underage according to Maharashtra's legal drinking age.

The incident and subsequent events have sparked public outrage and criticism, with questions raised about the delay in Mihir's arrest and concerns over the rise in hit-and-run accidents in Maharashtra. The case remains under investigation, with ongoing legal proceedings against Mihir and his associates involved in the tragic incident.",Crime and Justice,211,513
The Pioneer,2024-08-03 00:00:00,"Sebi working on templatised offer document for firms to fill in blanks’ to get approval, says Buch","Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch on Friday said the capital markets regulator is working on a mechanism to expedite IPO approvals, where companies can simply fill in the blanks in a template to get the go-ahead.

Separately, Sebi is also developing an artificial intelligence tool to check IPO documents being filed by companies for faster approvals, Buch said speaking at the Capam event of FICCI and added that this tool should be in place by December.

Stating that a mystique has been built around the IPO process like filing of a complex draft red herring prospectus, Buch said the attempt is to demystify the process now.

Elaborating on the “demystified offer document” aspect, Buch said Sebi is working on a process which will have a template where companies can just fill in the blanks to prepare the IPO document.

There will be a separate column for articulating any complexities and explaining the variations on a particular aspect, she said.

“The document will be precise, meaningful and any variation will be explained separately,” she said, adding that the new process will smoothen the processing time and also demystify the process.

She, however, did not spell out a timeline for implementation of the plan or also the process that will be followed in the run up.

Apart from this, the regulator is also working on a new process of fundraising for listed companies, which will be a combination of rights issue and a preferential allotment.

The overall duration for end-to-end process for getting the go-aheads will nearly halve to 23 days from the present 42 days for preferential issues, which is the fastest route of fundraise, she said.

Under the innovation, the watchdog is eliminating the need for getting approval from Sebi and will also do away with the requirement for merchant bankers as the fundraising document will be a simple two-page one listing out the necessary details for investors precisely.

Buch said this innovation, which will potentially deprive merchant bankers of the fees, is a homegrown solution and the idea has not come from the industry.

Sebi will be bringing a consultation paper on this idea before moving ahead with the proposal, she said, adding that the process will be cost-effective and faster.

Buch said making the IPO process faster has been a key objective for her, and pointed that there are eight applications which have exceeded the three month threshold at present due to lack of necessary regulatory approvals, judicial interventions and some non-compliances.

She also said that Sebi has taken an approach where it prefers to return documents when it discovers things like conflict of interest at merchant bankers’ ends, directors being accused of fraud, objects of issue not being clear or it being simply incomplete.

“We return the documents to unclutter the path so that the genuine applications are not delayed,” she added.

The new system of demystified offer document will help the young companies in its listing process, Buch said, adding that Sebi is also working on rationalising the disclosures to be made by a loss-making company in its listing.

The possible solutions will be out in a month, she said, adding that the solutions are being found courtesy the deliberations at the industry standard forum (ISF).

The Sebi management will also be taking the ISF to its board with the intent of formalising it, she said.

The board will also be seen deliberating on a proposal to streamline the ongoing disclosures to be made under the listing obligation and disclosure requirements (LODR) framework which have been formulated in consultation with the industry.

To help the errant companies who are in violation of securities laws, the regulator has also put in place a settlement amount calculator on its website, she said.

It is also working on a benchmarking agency which will help compare the performance of infrastructure investment trusts and real estate infrastructure trusts, she said.","Sebi Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch announced that the regulator is working on expediting IPO approvals through a new mechanism that involves a simplified template for companies to complete. This change aims to demystify the complex IPO process, with a new template featuring clear sections for complexities and variations. Additionally, Sebi is developing an AI tool to speed up the review of IPO documents, expected by December. 

Sebi is also introducing a faster fundraising process for listed companies, combining rights issues and preferential allotments into a simpler, two-page document, reducing approval time from 42 to 23 days. This change will eliminate the need for Sebi approval and merchant bankers. Buch emphasized that the aim is to make the process cost-effective and efficient.

The Pioneer,2025-01-03 00:00:00,Crowdfunding can transform science research funding,"By connecting directly with the public, crowdfunding offers researchers an opportunity to explore bold ideas fueled by passion

The conventional research funding model, which is primarily dependent on government grants and institutional allocations, is currently under increasing scrutiny. Scientists and innovators frequently find themselves facing competition for a diminishing pool of resources as budgets tighten and priorities shift in numerous regions of the globe.

A novel paradigm is emerging, one that is influenced by the digital economy: crowdfunding for research. Is it possible that this community-driven, decentralised approach could revolutionise the way we finance science? Government funding has been a cornerstone of scientific research across the globe, particularly in the domain of basic research. This funding plays a vital role in driving innovation, supporting the exploration of fundamental scientific principles, and fostering advancements that often serve as the foundation for applied research and technological development. Despite its critical importance, accessing government research grants presents significant challenges for scientists and institutions, making it a complex and often time-consuming endeavour.

The exhaustive application process is one of the foremost difficulties in securing government funding. Researchers must navigate hectic administrative paperwork, including filling out detailed forms, providing extensive documentation, and adhering to strict procedural guidelines. This bureaucratic overhead often becomes a distraction, diverting researchers’ time and energy away from their primary focus—scientific discovery.

Writing and refining grant proposals, ensuring compliance with submission requirements, and coordinating with institutional administrators consume weeks or even months. This process can be overwhelming for many scientists, particularly those involved with teaching responsibilities or other professional commitments.

Another challenge is the influence of governmental policy on funding priorities. The allocation of research funds is often tied to the strategic objectives of the ruling government. This means that researchers must tailor their proposals to align with themes or areas of focus deemed significant by policymakers.

As a result, projects that do not align with government priorities may struggle to find financial support, even if they hold substantial scientific or societal value. Moreover, the eligibility criteria for government funding further restrict access. Typically, government grants are available only to individuals holding doctoral degrees and those affiliated with recognised academic or research institutions, and some agencies restrict people from private institutions.

Crowdfunding is emerging as a revolutionary alternative to overcome these hurdles. Crowdfunding involves gathering financial support for a project or venture by soliciting small contributions from a large group of people, typically through online platforms.

It offers a direct, democratic, and flexible solution, empowering researchers to pursue their ideas with fewer constraints while promoting passion-driven inquiry. Crowdfunding allows researchers to connect directly with the public, garnering financial support for projects that resonate with a broader audience. Platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, FundRazr,  Hoope, GoFundMe, etc. have already successfully funded creative projects and their application in scientific research is growing. Crowdfunding science projects require researchers to dedicate considerable time and effort to campaign management, diverting resources away from their core research work. 

(The writer is an adjunct faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies; views are personal)","Crowdfunding is emerging as a potential game-changer for funding scientific research, offering an alternative to the traditional model dominated by government grants. As government funding becomes increasingly competitive and bureaucratic, crowdfunding allows researchers to directly engage with the public, securing financial support for projects driven by passion rather than government priorities. This model is particularly beneficial for those working on innovative ideas that may not align with government agendas. While crowdfunding offers flexibility and democratizes funding, it also presents challenges, such as the need for researchers to balance their time between conducting research and managing campaigns. Nevertheless, platforms like Kickstarter and GoFundMe are successfully expanding the scope of research funding, providing a promising avenue for passionate scientific inquiry.",Opinion and Editorial,118,505

Hindustan Times,2024-09-16 00:00:00,Using too much turmeric? Beware of these side effects,"From liver damage to sudden drop in blood sugar levels – here are the many ill-effects of consuming too much turmeric daily.
Turmeric is known for its many health benefits. From being anti-inflammatory in nature to consisting of antioxidant properties that help in healing the body – turmeric holds the reputation of being a healthy inclusion in the daily diet. However, is it all safe? 

Perhaps not – says Kristyn Hill, clinical pediatric and women’s health pharmacist in an article published on Health.com. The expert explained that too much turmeric can have ill-effects on the body, including gastrointestinal upset, blood thinning, and liver disease.

Trusted by 117M viewers! Follow HT YouTube channel for the latest news on India, sports & more!
Stomach or digestive upset:
One of the many side effects of consuming too much turmeric is that it can lead to disruption in the digestive system, such as abdominal distension, constipation, diarrhoea, indigestion, gas, acid reflux and yellow stool.

Skin rashes:
Often turmeric is applied to the face and the scalp for good hair and skin – however, the article states that it is often associated with causing skin rashes. Products containing turmeric or curcumin can lead to skin problems and should be immediately referred to for health expert supervision.

Increased bleeding:
Turmeric contains blood-thinning properties – it can directly block calcium signaling pathway which is essential for clotting blood and regularising blood circulation. This enhances the risk of increased bleeding. Nose or gum bleeding and blood spotting in stool or urine are side effects of turmeric consumption.

Lower blood sugar levels:
For people with type 2 diabetes, turmeric can help in regulating high blood sugar levels in the body. However, too much turmeric can lead to a sudden drop in blood sugar levels, which can have health implications in people with normal blood sugar levels.

Liver damage:
High doses of curcumin, or between 250-1,800 mg per day, can cause serious damage to the liver. Jaundice, abdominal pain, nausea and dark urine are some of the symptoms of a damaged liver and require immediate medical intervention.","The article highlights the potential risks of consuming excessive turmeric. While turmeric offers various health benefits, it can lead to negative side effects such as digestive issues, skin rashes, increased bleeding, lower blood sugar levels, and even liver damage when consumed in high doses. It recommends consulting a healthcare professional before consuming large amounts of turmeric.",Health and Wellness,56,347

Indian Express,2024-12-12 00:00:00,New Maharashtra Speaker: ‘My duty more important now due to lopsided numbers in House. No issue will be ignored because Opposition weak’,"There is a growing perception that Speakers tow their own party lines. With the Opposition numbers so low, should they be apprehensive of the same?
I do understand there is a perception that the Speaker is inclined towards the Treasury benches. However, there is no evidence to back this. You must not judge this House based on what happens in other states. One needs to look at an individual and then come to a conclusion.

I made it clear in my maiden speech in the House that I will give equal opportunities to the Treasury as well as Opposition Benches, despite their vast difference in numbers, as I believe the Opposition is crucial for the functioning of a parliamentary democracy. I would request the Opposition to not disrupt and boycott proceedings, or stage walkouts. People have sent MLAs to the House so that their issues can be raised.

If required, will you exercise jurisdiction to issue directives to the government on crucial issues?
The Speaker’s office is important for the existence of democracy. The Constitution has provided for three wings of governance – the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary. The Speaker’s office is the conduit between the Legislature and the Executive, and cannot be used as per the convenience of one side. For the people of Maharashtra to benefit, the Speaker is empowered to issue directives to the Executive and bureaucracy. I will use this power if the need arises. I have done it in the past too.

What do you plan to do?
I intend to issue a white paper on assurances given by the government. It will have details about the assurances given in the last Assembly and how many have been complied with.

I have also made it clear that the House is the temple of democracy and the actions of the members should be in accordance with parliamentary democracy. I will give equal opportunities to the Opposition so they are not forced to walk out.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis called for regulation of crowds on the Assembly premises..

In my last term too, I had said that the Assembly is an institution which must strictly be used for legislative work. However, we see scores of party workers and people coming to the Assembly to get their issues resolved. This is not the place for ministers and MLAs to address grievances. I am going to be very strict in this regard.

Apart from this, people who want to indulge in political tourism, if I may say so, also come. There is no harm in that, but we have to put a system in place and make use of public galleries to ensure their timely departure from the building. I have got an electronic gate access system installed, and the entry and exit passes will be controlled by the Speaker’s office.

No party has the numbers to stake claim to the Leader of the Opposition (LoP) post. Will you still give it?
The LoP is usually appointed by the Speaker and if any such proposal comes, I will take a decision based on what the Assembly rulebook and other enactments of the state government say, while also taking into account past precedents.

I have been hearing that Delhi has done this and Uttar Pradesh has done that. The Speaker’s office is an independent authority and is not bound or dependent on steps taken by other Assemblies.

How do you plan to run the House?
With the ruling alliance having almost a three-fourth majority, there is more responsibility on me to ensure that the lopsided numbers do not obstruct the Constitutional mandate of the Executive towards the Legislature. It will be my paramount duty to ensure this.

The agenda of the House too will be based on the Opposition’s demand, and if there are no satisfactory answers given, the issue will not be brushed under the carpet only because the MVA has low numbers.

Your first term as Speaker saw legal complexities associated with the split in the Shiv Sena? What is the status of the cases?
As the last Assembly has been dissolved, the matter of MLAs’ memberships is in a sense infructuous. However, the court is still hearing the matter and its decision will decide how the anti-defection law is likely to be interpreted in the future.

In the Shiv Sena case, the Supreme Court for the first time called upon the Speaker to decide which faction was the real party, but it was required to be done retrospectively, which means based on the day on which the alleged act of defection happened. So I had to decide which faction was the real party on June 25, 2022. The apex court had given me directives in this regard.

I also considered Schedule 10 of the Constitution and the rules of the Assembly while making my decision and I think my judgment is completely sustainable and will be upheld by the judiciary.

How do you look at the NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) case? Is there a correlation between the decisions of the Election Commission (EC) and Speaker on this?
In this case, there are two petitions. One is against the EC order recognising one faction (led by Ajit Pawar) as the real party and authorising it to use the name and symbol. While the second challenges the Speaker’s decision on the disqualification of MLAs. Both are independent and not correlated as the EC decision is prospective in nature while the Speaker’s is retrospective.

With the matter still sub-judice, what is your take?
The matter is being heard not only to rectify any wrongdoing but also to ensure the accurate implementation of the law.

I am not a party to it (the matter) and the court will now decide it. In case they hold the Speaker’s decision Constitutionally valid, it will become the law of the land. If not, the law will be what the courts decide.

What is your stand?
I am confident that my order is in accordance with the directives of the Supreme Court, well-reasoned and well within the four corners of law. Therefore, I do not see any reason why it should be altered or modified.

Has there been misuse of legislation to serve political interests?
Schedule 10 (anti-defection law) is a very important legislation which ensures parliamentary democracy is maintained. Using it should not result in misuse. Inter-party disagreements or differences of opinion must not be a cause for using the provisions of Schedule 10 as this will destroy the fabric of inter-party democracy.

Would you advise the BJP top brass to end ‘Operation Lotus’?
Political class or individuals are attracted towards the ideology and functioning of a political party, be it the BJP or any other party. Why should they be restricted? Schedule 10 is good enough to take care of those violating it.","The Speaker of the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly emphasized impartiality and equal opportunities for both the ruling and opposition parties, despite the latter's smaller numbers. He plans to issue a white paper on government assurances and enforce strict regulations on crowd control in the Assembly. Regarding the Leader of Opposition position, the Speaker will follow rules and past precedents. On ongoing legal matters, including the Shiv Sena split and NCP faction dispute, he stated that his decisions are in line with constitutional law and the Supreme Court’s directives. He also emphasized the importance of not misusing anti-defection laws for political gains.",Politics,100,1139
Indian Express,2024-12-31 00:00:00,Anurag Kashyap declares he is moving out of Mumbai because he is ‘disgusted’ by Hindi film industry: ‘I was ghosted by friends’,"“I am moving out of Mumbai,” filmmaker Anurag Kashyap declared in a recent interview. The Gangs of Wasseypur director expressed his discontent, stating that the joy of filmmaking has been “sucked out.” He blamed talent management agencies for setting the wrong trends by pushing aspiring actors to become stars rather than having them focus on becoming better actors. Kashyap accused these agencies of exploiting young actors for profit and abandoning them when they fail to deliver.

Speaking to The Hollywood Reporter India, Anurag lamented the escalating costs of filmmaking, attributing it to rising salaries and other factors. He said, “Now it is difficult for me to go out and experiment as it comes at a cost, which makes my producers think about profit and margins. Right from the beginning, before the film starts, it becomes about how to sell it. So, the joy of filmmaking is sucked out. That’s why I want to move out of Mumbai next year. I am going to the South. I want to go where there is stimulation. Otherwise, I will die as an old man. I am so disappointed and disgusted by my own industry. I am disgusted by the mindset.”
Kashyap emphasised how a film like Manjummel Boys would never be made in Hindi cinema but, if successful, would likely be remade in Hindi. “The mindset is to remake what’s already worked. They won’t try anything new,” he said.

He was particularly critical of agencies for fostering a damaging culture among budding actors. Kashyap explained, “The first-generation actors and the really entitled ones are very painful to deal with. Nobody wants to act—they all want to be stars. The agency won’t make anybody a star, but the moment someone becomes a star, the agency makes money off them. The onus of finding talent is on you—you have to take a risk and firefight with 50 people. And when the film is made, the agency grabs them and turns them into a star. They will brainwash them and tell them what they need to do to become a star. They won’t send them to workshops but to the gym—it’s all glam-glam because they have to be massive stars.”

Kashyap further accused agencies of creating a barrier between actors and filmmakers. He shared an incident about an actor who disappeared on the advice of his agency but later returned to him for career guidance after being dumped by the same agency. “This is what the agency does—they just make money off you. They aren’t invested in building new careers,” he said.

The filmmaker also expressed disappointment with actors he had previously considered friends. “My actors, whom I thought of as friends, ghost you because they want to be a certain way. That happens mostly here; it doesn’t happen in Malayalam cinema,” he added. Anurag recently made his acting debut in the Malayalam film Rifle Club, which also marked the acting debut of rapper Hanumankind.","Anurag Kashyap announced he is moving out of Mumbai, citing disillusionment with the current state of filmmaking, particularly the role of talent management agencies. He criticized these agencies for prioritizing star-making over acting skills and exploiting young talent for profit. Kashyap also expressed frustration with the industry's focus on commercial success rather than creative experimentation and highlighted his desire to move to the South for more stimulation. He also lamented the loss of genuine relationships with actors, noting how agencies fostered a disconnect between filmmakers and talent.",Entertainment,87,489
DNA,2024-07-25 00:00:00,Amitabh Bachchan reveals if Jaya Bachchan quit Bollywood to avoid conflicts in marriage: 'She was a huge star when...',"Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan are among the power couple of Bollywood, who have been going strong for 51 years. When Jaya Bachchan got married, she was already a superstar, and Amitabh was in his breakthrough year, delivering the superhit Zanjeer (released in May 1973). 

The couple got married on June 3, 1973, and they welcomed Shweta Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan. After having kids, Jaya started doing lesser films, and after Silsila (1981), she took a break from her career. Jaya's decision to step away led to speculations among fans and the film industry. 

However, Amitabh decided to clear the rumours and put an end to speculation on Jaya's decision to step back. In a video shared by Lehren from 1990, during a chat with a group of journalists, one of the members from the press asked Amitabh, ""This is a question that millions of your fans wanted to ask. Did Jaya ji leave movies to avoid an Abhimaan kind of a situation at home?”The Deewaar star clarified that it was Jaya's decision, ""No, I think she left something out of her own will. She felt that she was more required in the house and that’s why she left working in films. This is her own desire, if she wants to ever work again, she has the freedom to do so."" 

Amitabh further added ""As far as the story of Abhimaan is concerned, yes, of course, she was a huge star when I met her and continued to be one when I married her. But one of the things I had in my mind, and this is something really personal, was that if I was to marry her, I should really have my own standing and my own position. And that was one of the reasons why I was very keen to make it because I knew if I could make it, I could make it to the altar with Jaya."" On the work front, Amitabh is currently basking the success of Kalki 2898 AD","Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan's enduring relationship and mutual respect have always intrigued fans. Married for 51 years, they have navigated the ups and downs of their personal and professional lives with grace.

When Jaya Bachchan chose to step back from acting after the release of *Silsila* (1981), it sparked various rumors, particularly regarding the impact of their professional dynamics on their marriage. In a 1990 interview, Amitabh addressed these speculations, emphasizing that Jaya’s decision was driven by her own desire to focus on family life rather than any professional rivalry or internal conflict. He affirmed that Jaya’s departure from the film industry was a personal choice to fulfill her role at home, and that she had the freedom to return to acting if she wished.

Amitabh also shared that his motivation to succeed in his career was partly to ensure he could stand on his own merit when marrying Jaya, who was already a celebrated star at the time. This personal conviction highlighted his commitment to both his career and their relationship.

Currently, Amitabh Bachchan is enjoying the success of *Kalki 2898 AD*, continuing to be a prominent figure in Bollywood.",Entertainment,192,335

The statesman,2024-09-03 00:00:00,Baluchistan on the boil,"Baluchistan has been in flames in recent days. At the receiving end of a series of coordinated attacks last week, the Pakistan army suffered heavy casualties. Officially Pakistan admitted to over seventy killed including fourteen soldiers, 21 fighters of the BLA (Baluchistan Liberation Army), the organization which claimed responsibility for the attacks, and 23 Punjabis who were pulled out from public transport and executed. In addition, the BLA blocked roads and destroyed the railway bridge at Bolan, cutting off communication arteries.

The current attack, launched in multiple places, termed as Operation Herof by the BLA, involved detailed coordination and planning. As per Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper, “This has been the most widespread assault in years.” The BLA claimed that over 100 Pakistani soldiers were killed, and that those identified as non-Baloch in public transport were security personnel in civil dress. It was a direct confrontation which shook the national leadership. PM Shehbaz Sharif said that the army would be provided with all resources to root out terrorism at all costs.

The deputy PM, Ishaq Dar, offered talks with ‘disgruntled Baloch separatists.’ The President, Asif Ali Zardari mentioned, ‘The killing of innocent people is tantamount to killing the entire mankind.’ In 1948, Pakistan had coerced the Khan of Kalat to sign the instrument of accession, setting the stage for the commencement of the Baluch uprising, which has witnessed ups and downs. Baluchistan comprises 45 per cent of Pakistan’s landmass, possesses natural resources such as gas, gold, copper and coal and is the least populated province.

However, it remains one of Pakistan’s most backward regions, with over 40 per cent of its population living below the poverty line. This exploitation, alongside suppression by Pakistani armed forces, has resulted in enhanced distrust between the populace and Islamabad. Baluchistan is known for enforced disappearances, extrajudicial killings and fake encounters. While a commission of enquiry mentions there are less than 2,800 disappearances from 2002 to date, the Baloch claim the number to be above 7,000, while the Pakistan government believes them to be below 50. Mahrang Baloch, a woman human rights defender, heads the BYC (Baloch Yakjehti Committee), which is raising global awareness on enforced disappearances in the province.

Protests led by her are largely women dominated. Mahrang organized a 1600-km long march from Baluchistan to Islamabad in November 2023, to highlight extra judicial killings. It was broken up by security forces. At the end of July, BYC protests in Gwadar were called off based on talks with the government. It is reported that protests would recommence soon as the government has not stuck to its part of the deal. BYC protests and BLA’s military activities, though independent of each other, have resulted in the region facing the brunt of Pakistan’s military actions. Alongside them is the rising power of the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to add to Pakistan’s security woes. Pakistan’s headaches have increased, rather than decreased, since the arrival of the Taliban in Afghanistan. Their presence has emboldened both the TTP as also the BLA. The BLA has been declared a terrorist organization by both Pakistan and the US.

It targets Pakistani security forces as also Chinese assets including the CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor). The CPEC has always been a matter of concern for Balochis. Their belief is that the CPEC is designed for exploitation of their resources. Gwadar is an added bone of contention. Locals are prohibited from the city, including those who traditionally lived off fishing. The state failed to convince them that the CPEC would be of long-term benefit. Shehbaz Sharif mentioned, “They want to disrupt the development of Baluchistan and other parts of the country through the CPEC.” Ironically the attack occurred on the day when the Commander of the Chinese PLA Ground Forces, Gen Li Qiaoming, was in Islamabad to discuss further military and economic cooperation.

The messaging could not have been clearer. BLA attacks have impeded Chinese investments. This was evident when Shehbaz Sharif returned empty handed from Beijing in June this year. Dawn, in an editorial last week, blamed India and Afghanistan for backing the BLA. It mentioned, “Strong evidence is said to link some of them to India and other neighbouring countries who are opposed to the idea of a secure Pakistan.” However, the BLA has bases in Iran, which Pakistan avoids mentioning, fearing deterioration in relations. The fact remains that the BLA’s retaliation stems from excessive employment of the Pakistan army. Instead of winning over neutral population as also providing the region with development, it has been suppressing people, adding to public anger.

The current attacks also coincided with the death anniversary of Nawab Akbar Bugti, a former governor and chief minister of Baluchistan, amongst the most powerful tribal chieftains, killed in a military operation on 26 August 2006. Such specific days ought to have called for additional security measures, which were not taken, implying laxity on the part of the army. The basic cause of growing discontent against the Pakistan army is its policy of suppression, rather than winning hearts and alienating separatists and terrorists. Current leaders of the BLA are educated middle class individuals. Its current head, Dr Allah Nazar, is a gold medallist from the Bolan medical college.

Allah Nazar’s brother was killed in illegal custody, while he himself was arrested in 2005. This continued policy of repression has ensured that the BLA will never be short of volunteers. Most members of the group were forced into picking up arms due to enforced disappearances of their family members or being tortured by the Pakistan army. Unlike Kashmir, which India is developing rapidly, changing mindsets and creating employment opportunities, Baluchistan is left to fend for itself, while its resources are milked. This has added to anger.

The fact that women activists, including mothers, are becoming suicide bombers only highlights the fact that the state has failed in reaching out to the public. Sadly, the world has not woken up to atrocities being committed by Pakistan’s security forces in the region, as it has in other parts of the world. Unless world pressure increases and forces Pakistan to see sense, these rounds of attacks would continue followed by repression.","Baluchistan has been engulfed in violence recently, with nine Maoists killed in coordinated attacks by the Baluchistan Liberation Army (BLA) on Pakistani security forces. The BLA’s ""Operation Herof"" led to significant casualties, including 14 soldiers, 21 BLA fighters, and 23 Punjabis. The operation disrupted transportation by destroying a railway bridge and blocking roads. This escalation follows Union Home Minister Amit Shah's declaration to eradicate Naxal insurgency by March 2026. Baluchistan, rich in resources but impoverished and oppressed, faces severe unrest, exacerbated by military repression and human rights abuses. The BLA, disillusioned with Pakistan’s exploitation and suppression, has intensified attacks, including on Chinese assets. Despite government attempts at dialogue and development, deep-rooted discontent and violence persist, compounded by historical grievances and the BLA’s ongoing insurgency.",International News,124,1028

The Indian Express,2024-10-08 00:00:00,Express View on Jaishankar’s Pakistan visit: A long road ahead,"There is a frisson of anticipation ahead of External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s visit to Pakistan on October 15-16 for the summit-level meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). After all, the last time an Indian Foreign Minister was in the country was nine years ago when Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad for the Heart of Asia Conference on Afghanistan in December 2015. Her trip was followed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi going to Lahore to meet then-Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif. Since then, however, the bilateral relationship has been on a downward trajectory. A thaw in ties seems unlikely in the near term.

The elephant in the room remains Pakistan’s use of cross-border terror as a part of its security and strategic calculus. Despite the fact that its support for extremist groups has had grave consequences domestically, Rawalpindi continues to support separatist elements across the border. As Minister Jaishankar said at an event in New Delhi on Saturday, “if you’re all sitting together and cooperating, and at the same time, you know this kind of terrorism go(ing) on openly… in which case, you are normalising it, you are accepting that this is a legitimate tool of statecraft.” It is for this reason that the SAARC has become nearly defunct. Islamabad, for its part, is stuck with the maximalist position it took in the aftermath of the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. Its stand that Delhi must undo the change in Jammu & Kashmir’s constitutional status as a precursor for dialogue cannot now be softened without political consequences domestically.

Jaishankar has made it clear that the visit is for the multilateral SCO summit and not to discuss India-Pakistan ties. When the then Foreign Minister of Pakistan, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, visited India for the SCO meet last year, he exchanged barbs with Jaishankar, who had reacted sharply to Bhutto’s comments on Kashmir. A similar script could well play out in Islamabad this month. It is possible, of course, that Jaishankar interacts with leaders in Pakistan who have in the past hinted at less hostile ties with India. Such an engagement is important in itself and, given the volatile nature of Pakistan’s politics, a hedge for the future. At the current moment, however, Pakistan’s domestic political turmoil and uncertainty mean that it is not just a question of whether the SCO meeting is an appropriate forum to build bridges but also of who to build those bridges with. Jailed former PM Imran Khan’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), has been protesting alleged delays in implementing the judicial verdict recognising its legislators and allowing the PTI to nominate women and minority members to the country’s National Assembly. The timing of the protests also casts a shadow over the SCO meeting. The PTI under Khan has directly challenged the Pakistan Army. Given this political uncertainty and continuing disagreements on core issues, the visit can, at best, be the first step in a long road to better ties between the two countries.","External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar is set to visit Pakistan on October 15-16 for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, marking the first visit by an Indian Foreign Minister to Pakistan in nine years. Despite the visit, a thaw in India-Pakistan relations is unlikely due to ongoing tensions over Pakistan’s support for cross-border terrorism and its hard stance on Kashmir following the abrogation of Article 370.

Jaishankar clarified that his visit is solely for the multilateral SCO summit, not for bilateral talks. The strained relationship between the two countries, compounded by Pakistan’s political turmoil, makes meaningful dialogue challenging. The political uncertainty in Pakistan, including protests by Imran Khan’s party, PTI, against the military, further complicates the prospects for reconciliation. The visit may, however, serve as a small step toward future engagement, though significant breakthroughs appear distant.",Opinion and Editorial,136,497

The Hans India,2024-11-16 00:00:00,Small Farmers Gain Less by Selling to Supermarkets: Study Reveals  ,"A study conducted by the Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition (TCI) at Cornell University reveals that while selling produce to supermarkets can increase farmers' income by approximately 14%, small and resource-poor farmers are less likely to benefit from this arrangement. The research, based on field studies across four Indian states, indicates that farmers with better resources, such as irrigation facilities and specialized vegetable farms, are more inclined to supply to supermarkets. In contrast, smaller farms with limited assets often continue to rely on traditional marketplaces.

The study found that farmers selling to supermarkets had an average net income of ₹83,461, compared to ₹71,169 for those selling in conventional markets. However, the benefits of supermarket sales are not uniformly distributed, as smaller farms face challenges in meeting the quality and quantity requirements of supermarket procurement systems. The research emphasizes the need for supportive policies and infrastructure to enable small farmers to access modern retail markets and enhance their income.","The article discusses a study highlighting that small farmers in India gain less by selling to supermarkets due to resource constraints.

He is a strong believer of the dictum – ‘If the acting is right, it covers for the character’s appearance.’ In a recent interview, Chaubey gave an example about his casting process and also shared how Kareena Kapoor and Diljit Dosanjh would never sit on set with the actress even refusing to put her makeup on for the film.

In an interview with Mashable India, the filmmaker said, “When we had conceived the character of Sartaj in Udta Punjab, he was supposed to be this mountain of a man. A proper 6 feet guy with heavy voice. Typical Punjabi look. But when we did the casting, we cast Diljit Dosanjh, who looked nothing like we imagined for the character. But, he was a great actor. He is an actual Sardar.”



Abhishek Chaubey also shared his experience of working with Kareena Kapoor in Udta Punjab. After seeing a BTS photo of himself with the actor, the filmmaker recalled, “Kareena gives this expression that she doesn’t care about what you are saying, but that’s not true. She actually listens very carefully.”

“And I will tell you something very interesting about Diljit and Kareena. They never sat on set. Usually, what happens after an actor gives his or her shot, they either return to their vanity or sit on the back with a book or so, but these two would never sit. These two would just follow me everywhere I go. Kareena is a superstar and yet she would always stand behind me and so did Diljit Dosanjh. I would ask him to sit, but he never would. I would shoot in various location in the village and Kareena would always stand and watch,” he added.

Abhishek Chaubey further praised Kareena Kapoor, saying she “knows how to mould herself” as per the requirement of the project.

The filmmaker said, “There is this great thing about Kareena. She is a true blue industry kid and she has an instinctive understanding of the kind of film and the performance that is expected of her. There is no lack of skill and craft. Whether it is a David Dhawan film or a Govind Nihalani film, she knows how to mould herself. She knew what kind of film we were making. She was aware of the kind of pitch that was needed for the performance. She wouldn’t put on makeup. I used to request her ‘thoda makeup karlo’, but she wouldn’t. She was amazing.”

Another addition to this list is Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon-starrer action comedy Shehzada.

Shehzada is the official Hindi remake of the 2020 Telugu blockbuster hit Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo headlined by Allu Arjun.

hindu,2024-12-10 00:00:00,Operation Paul Bunyan: The US Military’s Showdown Over a Tree,"Imagine a scene straight out of a spy thriller: the tension of military forces gathering, the solemnity of a high-stakes operation, and all of it revolving around, of all things, a tree. Sounds like a plotline you’d expect to see in a blockbuster movie, right? But, it’s not fiction—Operation Paul Bunyan was an actual operation, one that stands out as a unique and bizarre chapter in the history of the U.S. military.

This operation, which took place in 1976, was rooted in the heart of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), a highly sensitive area on the border between North and South Korea. It all started over something as simple as a tree, but the consequences were anything but simple. With tensions high and stakes even higher, the U.S. military found itself in the middle of a stand-off where one seemingly ordinary tree became the catalyst for a confrontation that nearly escalated into a much larger conflict.

So, what exactly happened during Operation Paul Bunyan? What was at stake for the U.S., and how did this event change the dynamics of international military engagement? Let’s break it down and dive into the remarkable tale of how a tree led to one of the most intense military operations of the 20th century.","The Incident That Sparked Operation Paul Bunyan
The year was 1976, and the world was living in the midst of the Cold War. North Korea and South Korea were separated by the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, a strip of land that symbolized the division of the Korean Peninsula. Despite being labeled a “demilitarized” zone, the area was anything but peaceful. In fact, it was the site of frequent skirmishes and standoffs between the forces of the North and South.

It was in this volatile environment that a seemingly innocent tree became the focal point of an international crisis. The tree in question was located near Panmunjom, the joint security area of the DMZ where North and South Korean soldiers stood face to face. In August 1976, two U.S. soldiers, Lieutenant Mark Barrett and Private First Class, Keith C. L., were killed by North Korean forces while attempting to cut down the tree. The men had been ordered to remove the tree, which obstructed the line of sight between U.S. and South Korean forces.

The brutal killing of the two soldiers in broad daylight was a bold act of aggression, pushing tensions to a breaking point. The U.S. government could not let such an incident pass without a response, but what action could they take against such a brazen attack, especially in such a volatile region?",Politics,225,210
Hindustan Times ,2024-08-27 00:00:00,Australia to limit foreign student enrolments in migration crackdown,"AUSTRALIA-IMMIGRATION/STUDENTS:Australia to limit foreign student enrolments in migration crackdown.SYDNEY, - Australia said on Tuesday it would limit the enrolment number of international students at 270,000 for 2025, as the government looks to rein in record migration that has contributed to a spike in home rental prices.The decision follows a raft of actions since last year to end COVID-era concessions for foreign students and workers in Australia that helped businesses recruit staff locally while strict border controls kept overseas workers out.

""There's about 10% more international students in our universities today than before the pandemic and about 50% more in our private vocational and training providers,"" Education Minister Jason Clare told a press conference.

The reforms are designed to make the international student sector better and fairer, and this will set it up on a more sustainable footing going forward, Clare said.International education is one of Australia's largest export industries and was worth A$36.4 billion to the economy in the 2022-2023 financial year.

But polls have showed voters are concerns about large influxes of foreign students and workers putting excess pressure on the housing market, making immigration one of the potential major battlegrounds in an election less than an year away.

Net immigration hit a record high in the year to Sept. 30, 2023, surging 60% to a record 548,800, higher than the 518,000 people in the year ending June 2023.

Australia boosted its annual migration numbers in 2022 to help businesses recruit staff to fill shortages after the COVID-19 pandemic brought strict border controls, and kept foreign students and workers out for nearly two years.The record migration - driven by students from India, China and Philippines - has expanded labour supply and restrained wage pressures, but it exacerbated an already tight housing market.

In a bid to contain the surge in migration, the government last month more than doubled the visa fee for foreign students and pledged to close loopholes in rules that allowed them to continuously extend their stay.","Australia is set to limit foreign student enrollments as part of a broader migration crackdown aimed at addressing concerns over population growth and immigration. The government’s decision comes in response to the rising number of international students, which has significantly contributed to the country’s migration intake. The move is part of an effort to better manage the impact of high immigration levels on infrastructure, housing, and public services.The policy is expected to tighten the criteria for student visas, with a focus on ensuring that students genuinely intend to study rather than using education as a pathway to permanent residency. Additionally, the government may impose caps on the number of students admitted to certain courses or institutions, particularly those that have been identified as high-risk for misuse of the visa system.This crackdown is likely to have significant implications for Australia’s education sector, which heavily relies on international students as a major source of revenue. Universities and educational institutions may face challenges in adapting to these new restrictions, potentially leading to a decrease in foreign student enrollments.

While the government argues that the measures are necessary to maintain the integrity of the migration system, the decision has sparked debate about the potential economic and social impacts on the country’s education system and broader economy.",International News,212,330
hindustan time,2024-08-28 00:00:00,"Virat Kohli branded as 'villain' by Aussie great, says BCCI 'loaned' Border-Gavaskar Trophy from Australia for 10 years","The great Virat Kohli is set to embark upon his fifth trip of Australia later this year when India tour Down Under for a taxing five-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The Indian batting stalwart loves playing against Australia as his statistics of 2042 runs from 25 Tests at an average of 47.49 reflect. This is the most Kohli has scored against any Test-playing nation, with his second-best performance coming against England – 1991 runs from 28 Tests at 42.36. The last two times Kohli toured Australia, India emerged victorious in both. In 2018/19, Kohli led India to their first-ever Test series win in Australia and although he had to return home after playing just one game in the 2020/21 series, Ajinkya Rahane stepped in brilliantly to take India to a famous win.Three years later, things are different. Kohli is no longer the captain, and Rahane is not part of the Indian Test team. Rohit Sharma has taken over the reins and has a shot at immortality – lead India to a hat-trick of series win in Australia, which up until a decade ago, would have qualified as nothing more than sarcasm. Kohli's love affair with Australia began 13 years ago, when on his first series Down Under, he scored a maiden Test century. Over the next 21 Tests, he took his tally of centuries against the Aussies up by seven, including a once-in-a-lifetime twin tons in Adelaide, and in the process, formed a love-hate relationship with the Australian crowd.

Could this be Kohli's last Test tour of Australia? He is 35, so perhaps not. But irrespective of whether this is his swansong, former Aussie great Geoff Lawson reckons Kohli can expect a mixed reaction from the crowd. So what if he's stepped down as India captain? The fire still burns within Kohli. In 2012, a brash Kohli had flipped the crowd in a sight never to be forgotten by Australia, and over the years, his hot-and-cold relationship with the audience has only added more layers to it.""Virat Kohli will play the faux villain to Jasprit Bumrah's likeable nature. Bumrah has the fast bowlers privilege of [spending] half a life at fine leg which gives him the ideal chance to interact with the crowd, winning smiles and hearts while Kohli will lurk in the infield appealing vociferously, fielding magnificently and engaging verbally with any Australian player so inclined to conversation, and there will be one or two of those,"" Lawson told Mid-day.

""Aussie crowds love a competitor like Kohli, they may give him some grief if he plays the antagonist but you can guarantee that if he makes 50s and 100s he will be loudly applauded by the fans. He has shown a liking for Australian conditions ever since his first tour 13 years ago. Bounce and pace suited his two-footed game but the question in 2024 is whether he still has the razor sharpness to best Australia’s attack on their home surfaces. I wouldn't count him out.""","Virat Kohli is set for his fifth tour of Australia later this year as India competes in a five-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Kohli has a stellar record against Australia, with 2,042 runs from 25 Tests at an average of 47.49, making them his most frequent opponents. His last two tours to Australia resulted in victories for India, including a historic series win in 2018/19 under Kohli's captaincy, and a famous triumph in 2020/21 led by Ajinkya Rahane. 

Now, as Kohli, aged 35, embarks on this tour under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma, former Australian cricketer Geoff Lawson anticipates a mixed reaction from the crowds. Despite stepping down as captain, Kohli's fiery nature and competitive spirit will likely spark both animosity and admiration. Lawson predicts that while Kohli may face some jeers as a perceived antagonist, his performances could earn him applause from Australian fans, who appreciate his skill and tenacity.",Sports,152,498

On DAY 1 of the Sydney Test, Usman Khwaja made Indian pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah wait as he was about to begin his run-up, to ensure it would be the final over of the day.
If this was not enough, Konstas, who was on the non-strikers end attempted to catch Bumrah off guard, which followed an exchange of words. Before it could reach a tipping point, the umpires intervened.
With barely renowned batters daring to challenge the Indian magician, the Australian had to pay the price for this altercation and loose Usman Khwaja on the final delivery of the day.
Following this, Bumrah charged up at Konstas and then stared down at him in celebration. Not only Bumrah but India's star batter Virat Kohli sprinted from the slip region in celebration and then charged up at Konstas. Other players, like Prasidh Krishna, were seen laughing at the opener.

Sam Konstas has much to learn. I hope the dressing room is offering that guidance without suppressing his confidence and youthful enthusiasm, he wrote, on X.
He pointed out that Khawaja was in control but was distracted by Konstas's act and this led to hid dismissal. Usman had it all under control, what he didnt need was the distraction of having to settle his partner down at the non strikers end!

The Asian Age,2024-08-08 00:00:00,"AA Edit | Lineup out, gloves are off as US heads to prez polls","It is all set for a battle royale as the US Democratic Party, much energised after Kamala Harris took over the nomination for the presidential election when White House resident Joe Biden threw in the towel because of old age, is ready to face the Republican Party’s Donald Trump. Keeping her ideological credentials intact, Ms Harris chose the left-liberal leaning progressive governor of Minnesota as her running mate. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz versus Donald Trump and J.D. Vance is the billing for the big fight now.
It is not without old fears resurfacing and new anxieties building that the US heads to its November 5 date with democracy. As one assassination bid on Mr Trump failed and other conspiracies against both candidates were spotted and squashed in time, the events are seen as symbolic of a postmodern United States, with its endless arguments over gun control in an increasingly fractious world beset by divisiveness of all kinds.
How much has changed even as battle lines were being drawn for these crucial elections that may have repercussions for the world at large became apparent in the popularity polls closing to a point where it might be difficult to call out who is the clear favourite. The thumping lead Mr Trump seemed to enjoy in the immediate aftermath of a sniper failing in his lone wolf attempt on the former President seems to have thinned out as Joe Biden decided over a weekend that his critics were right about his age working against him.
Kamala Harris, with the highest communication skills, is a different proposition for the convicted felon of a former President. Indeed, Mr Trump was lording it over a fumbling Mr Biden whose cognitive abilities were seen folding up against the challenge of the job besides having to handle the campaign in which the debate appearance proved decisive as the worst fears over his mental fitness emerged. The odds have changed with the gap between the leading contenders in public rating closing in to negligible percentages.
In deciding to pick Tim Walz from Minnesota rather than John Shapiro of Pennsylvania, who might have struggled to attract votes at a time when Israel has stoked conflicting feelings and loyalties in the US with its war on the Palestinians, Kamala’s instincts may have led her to the better option. There may be huge unknowns as the campaign cranks up to speed, but with support and dollars pouring in, Kamala and Walz may have given the Democrats their best shot at retaining the power of the presidency. Campaign speeches about the candidates and their deputies are bound to get even more interesting as the representatives of both parties feel no need to observe any courtesies, or even acceptable taste in deeply personal attacks. But that is par for the course in politics, more so in the land of free speech where no-holds-barred campaigns light up the period to the polls. Never the one to back down, Mr Trump, who brought race and “birthism” into his speeches once Kamala’s name came on to the ticket, had also made an unusual pick for running mate in Mr Vance, a politician who had had the nastiest things to say of him. The verbal battles have been sharp enough already as the country with the world’s biggest economy and its most powerful military goes to the polls in 2024, the year of notable elections round the world.","The 2024 US presidential election is shaping up to be a fierce battle between Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for the Democratic Party and Donald Trump with J.D. Vance for the Republicans. Harris, having taken over the nomination from Joe Biden, chose the progressive Minnesota governor Walz as her running mate. The election has become increasingly contentious, with Trump facing multiple assassination attempts and conspiracies, while public opinion polls show a narrowing gap between the candidates.
Kamala Harris is seen as a formidable opponent to Trump, with her strong communication skills and ability to appeal to a broad spectrum of voters. Her choice of Walz over Pennsylvania’s John Shapiro, amid rising tensions over Israel, is considered a strategic one. As the campaign heats up, personal attacks and divisive rhetoric are expected to dominate, with Trump having already used race-based rhetoric against Harris.The election is critical for global implications, as the outcome will influence the future direction of the world’s largest economy and military power. Both parties are gearing up for a highly charged, no-holds-barred race to the White House.",International News,179,571
Hindustan Times ,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"Guest Column| Lost and found, tracing Bob’s escapades down memory lane","Bob had an enemy too; a German shepherd down the road was often on the loose and would invariably go for him, biting him on a few occasions, albeit slightly, before we decisively intervened It was, I think, September of summer 1983. Pub gardens were full and many were swaying to Madonna’s just released Holiday. On vacation from Oxford University early one evening, I was driving to visit a relative at Walton-on-Thames with our pet corgi, Bob, (yes, no prizes for originality in the naming stakes) in the back, windows down to allow him to savour the fresh English air, invigorated no doubt by the river.

Bob, our corgi, was a rascal. He would scupper to neighbours’ homes at every opportunity and return sheepishly. (Shutterstock)
Bob, our corgi, was a rascal. He would scupper to neighbours’ homes at every opportunity and return sheepishly. (Shutterstock)
I’ve always loved how drivers leave the car window slightly ajar and the pet dog invariably reaches up, nose protruding, to enjoy the cooling effect of the passing air. Yet others would wind the window right down to allow the canine to rest both front paws on the door, head nearly fully out, rocking from side to side. Moving on from a traffic light stop close to my destination I suddenly realised that Bob was no longer there and could either have been dognapped or had slyly flown out of the window.

Recalling now that it was a warm evening, and the car certainly did not have air conditioning, my guess was that the rear window must have been fully down. Panicking, I rapidly returned to the previous set of traffic lights, parked the car and started looking around, asking every dog-walker I met, for help. Luckily, most knew what a corgi looks like. Of course, these days one would have photos on the mobile to show.

Three hours later with the night closing in, I had to give up and return home to deliver the sad news.

The whole family was distraught. Those who had not dined, me included, did not eat that evening. Many tears were shed. The home was eerily quiet. Bob was a rascal. He would scupper to neighbours’ homes at every opportunity and return sheepishly. We always knew where to look for him. But he was always alert. No one could step an inch on the forecourt without Bob’s shrill warning. The postman for sure, whilst vary of him, would always toy with him by putting the letters through the letterbox, one item at a time.

For his endurance, the postman, like the milkman and the dustmen, received his just rewards every Christmas. Bob had an enemy too. A German shepherd down the road was often on the loose and would invariably go for Bob, biting him on a few occasions, albeit slightly, before we decisively intervened. Bob was family; gifted to us as an adult some two years earlier and everyone’s favourite, not least because the Queen had corgis too. So we agreed to form a posse of four searchers to return next morning to the area where I believed he had got lost.

Within 15 minutes we came across an old lady who guided us closer to the river where stray dogs, she suggested, often gathered. Less than five minutes later responding to multiple soundings of his name from different directions I suddenly saw Bob scurrying out from under a car, soiled with axle grease but otherwise peppy. I grabbed him with both arms and we all hurtled back to the car, holding back tears of joy with difficulty.

On visits abroad, I often see notices put up on lamp-posts, letterboxes, shop windows and supermarket notice boards about lost pets, which with my own experiences I can relate to. Bob remained a member of our family for another 10 years, even surviving a cancer scare in 1988 when the vet had recommended we get him put down.The day he died no food was cooked at our home. We buried him at the back of our garden.

P.S. Those seeking to buy a pet should try to understand that it’s for life and not for a month’s joy. Many don’t.

Hindustan Times,2024-10-01 00:00:00,"Swachh Bharat Mission: Creating jobs, transforming lives","In 2014, India took a collective pledge to ensure cleanliness, health, and hygiene for all its citizens through the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM). This nationwide campaign, driven by the vision of a clean India, has transformed sanitation across both urban and rural landscapes, making cleanliness a priority for millions. By promoting sustainable waste management practices, the mission has empowered communities, improved public health, and sparked a cultural shift towards hygiene. A study in Nature estimated that the SBM programme has been instrumental in averting 60,000–70,000 infant deaths annually since its launch. According to World Health Organization (WHO) data, by 2025, an additional 677.3 million people in India are expected to benefit from improved health and well-being compared to 2018.
While the impact of SBM on public health has been widely documented, its contribution extends far beyond. When governments and communities invest in public health and hygiene, they build infrastructure and institutions that have a ripple effect on multiple aspects of development. By focusing on long-term behavioural change and sustainable impact rather than short-term outputs like toilet construction, SBM has set a movement in motion that will continue to influence health, education, livelihoods, economic growth, women’s empowerment, and the environment in the distant future too.
Take, for example, the livelihood benefits under SBM. In its first phase, when sanitation infrastructure was being developed at a massive scale, over 110 million toilets were constructed, providing direct employment to 2.59 million full-time workers and indirect employment to 4.95 million more. Jobs ranged from labourers and masons to engineers and sanitation workers. More significantly, the program also empowered women, training women masons, known as Rani Mistries, to construct sanitation infrastructure under the mission. These efforts created new livelihoods for women, transforming their role in their communities.
In the second phase of SBM, the focus shifted to solid and liquid waste management, spurring the growth of the waste management industry. This has generated jobs in the collection, transportation, processing, and recycling of waste. Women, once again, play a crucial role through self-help groups (SHGs) leading waste management initiatives. We’ve seen this first-hand through the Light House Initiative (LHI), a public-private partnership led by the India Sanitation Coalition (ISC), the department of drinking water and sanitation (ministry of Jal Shakti), and large corporates through their CSR initiatives. Under LHI, women-led SHGs in rural areas have driven waste collection, educated communities on segregation, and unlocked value from waste through composting and recycling. One inspiring example under LHI involves SHGs turning multi-layered plastic waste into fashionable products like tote bags and planters. These upcycling efforts not only provide livelihoods but also promote sustainability. Vulnerable communities, particularly women, have been empowered to tackle environmental challenges while improving their economic conditions. Additionally, by teaching communities how to manage waste themselves, LHI has promoted local expertise and utilisation of local resources.
Looking forward, the operation and management of SBM models and infrastructure present vast employment potential, particularly for plumbers, sanitation workers, and skilled labourers in the plastic waste management industry. Initiatives like ISC’s Plastic Circularity project are working to mainstream marginalised waste workers, offering them opportunities to establish micro-enterprises in plastic waste management. Through training, capacity building, and access to funding—via CSR funds and blended finance—these workers are becoming integral players in India’s formal waste value chain. The convergence of government schemes, such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the National Skill Development Mission, and the National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM), further strengthens these efforts. These programmes have supported the upskilling and livelihoods of workers in sanitation and waste management, while initiatives like SBM provide the framework for their application. Organisations like ISC, with support from the private sector, are poised to further scale these initiatives, ensuring that sanitation and waste management continue to drive community empowerment and economic growth.
Ultimately, programmes like SBM are more than just about toilets and waste management—they are about transforming lives. By improving health and hygiene, we improve human capital, driving both individual prosperity and national economic growth. The Swachh Bharat Mission is not just a mission for cleanliness; it is a key driver of societal transformation in India, contributing to improved human capital and national economic growth. SBM’s focus on skilling has not only ensured the programme's success but has also created a blueprint for sustainable community development that will continue to benefit India for generations to come. Continued funding and support from government will ensure that the country can capitalise on past gains and ensure there is no sliding back to old ways.","The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) has transformed sanitation in India, improving health, hygiene, and public infrastructure. Beyond cleanliness, it has created jobs, empowered women, and driven sustainable waste management. By focusing on long-term behavioural change, SBM has promoted human capital development, economic growth, and community empowerment, ensuring benefits for future generations. Continued government support is crucial for sustaining these gains.",Environment,60,752

Asked if he supports the advisory, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) president said in an interaction with PTI editors, “No, I don’t.” He said he believes two classes of people – rich and poor – exist in the society and persons of different castes and religions fall in both categories.

“We need to bridge the gap between these two classes of people. It is every government’s responsibility to work for the poor, which includes all sections of society such as Dalits, backward, upper castes, and Muslims as well. All are there. We need to work for them,” Paswan said.
He added, “Whenever there is such divide in the name of caste or religion, I absolutely do not either support it or encourage it.

Mint,2024-11-01 00:00:00,Lower duties likely for EVs priced up to $35k,"Foreign electric vehicle (EV) makers such as Tesla Inc. seeking an Indian foothold may have relief at hand, with the government considering lower import duties for EVs up to a certain price level, two people familiar with the discussions said.

All completely built-up (CBUs) vehicles priced below $40,000 now face an import duty of 70%, and a new national EV policy may slash it to 15-30% for EVs priced up to $25,000-35,000, the people said on the condition of anonymity. At 15% duty, these CBUs will be on par with the import duty for CKD (completely knocked down) cars. This will also come with the caveat that they begin local manufacturing in the next two to three years and a clause to claw back the duty sop if they fail to do so.

Elon Musk’s Tesla recently made a second push to reduce EV duties in India as it scouts for new markets amid a slowdown in the West and growing competition from local players in China. The American carmaker is targeting customers at the top end of India’s growing mass-premium segment of EVs and does not want to be a luxury player competing for a small set of wealthy buyers, the people said. India’s electric car market is close to doubling sales this year, up from nearly 33,000 last year.

“They (Tesla) could start with 50,000 CBUs,” one of the two people said. “Their product will be in the range of $25,000-35,000, which is what they’ve discussed with the government. They are, however, still finalizing what products they’d like to bring to the country. Tesla is also looking if they can hit the $20,000 price point, but it’s all under discussions right now.”

Tesla has been targeting a lower price band of about ₹20 -30 lakh for EVs in India, the person cited above said. This could be the lower variant of the Model 3, which is offered at nearly $39,000 in the US, or a brand new, smaller $25,000 EV, which it is reportedly developing for the US as well as global markets.

A new EV policy with lower duties will benefit foreign automakers like Tesla, who commit to local manufacturing, but may disappoint local automakers such as Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, which have committed to significant EV investments. However, the government believes the policy could attract new investment to the country in an increasingly important sector and provide a level-playing field to foreign entrants since those with domestic operations are eligible to benefit from its production-linked incentives (PLI) scheme.

The department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) is anchoring the discussions. The department has sought feedback from various departments and domestic automakers on the matter, but formal industry and stakeholder consultations are yet to take place, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.

A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond till press time.

“European luxury carmakers such as BMW, Audi and Mercedes Benz will likely stay in the luxury space with their EV offerings. Those manufacturers will be unable to compete at these price points. Tesla is not in their space. Even if the price is fixed at $35,000, the question is whether they will be willing to make significant investments in India,” the first official said. “They (Tesla) can go up to 300,000-400,000 cars in India per year. This year, we could have 100,000 EVs. Tesla is a highly vertically integrated manufacturer whose game is in high volumes, and they cannot be viable at small volumes,” he added.

“The government should approach these policy changes in a phased manner,” said Gaurav Vangaal, associate director of S&P Global Mobility. “There should be some production target for OEMs so they start building locally. Doing so will give them an edge in the domestic market. It is necessary to open up the market and allow the EV ecosystem to develop much faster. We need to see the price and specifications of the Tesla model that comes to India before gauging how competitive it will be. But the C and D segments (at about $30,000-35,000) will see an impact where new ground-up EVs will be introduced in the market. The Indian market is maturing and car prices are steadily going up,” Vangaal added.","The Indian government is considering lowering import duties for electric vehicles (EVs) priced up to $25,000-35,000 to attract foreign manufacturers like Tesla. Currently, completely built-up (CBU) vehicles below $40,000 face a 70% import duty, which may be reduced to 15-30% for EVs in the specified price range. However, this reduction would be contingent upon the manufacturers starting local manufacturing within two to three years. Tesla, aiming to tap into India's growing mass-premium EV segment, is discussing bringing CBUs priced between $25,000-35,000, potentially even aiming for a $20,000 price point. While this policy would benefit foreign automakers committing to local manufacturing, it may disappoint domestic players like Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, who have made significant EV investments. The move aims to attract new investment and level the playing field for foreign entrants. The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is leading the discussions. However, stakeholders emphasize the need for a phased approach and production targets for OEMs to stimulate local manufacturing and nurture the EV ecosystem. ",Business and Finance,170,709

The Disaster Management and Relief Ministry, while giving out updates on the flood situation, said the highest deaths were reported from Cumilla and Feni districts, both adjoining the border with Tripura in India on the northeast side, with 14 and 23 deaths respectively.
Monsoon rainfall-triggered floods in deltaic Bangladesh and upstream Indian regions have wreaked havoc in the country for about two weeks resulting in deaths and displacement of humans and cattle, and loss of property posing a huge administrative challenge to the newly installed interim government amid a political transition.Bangladesh is crisscrossed by more than 200 rivers, 54 of them being trans-boundary rivers with upper riparian India, in four major basins.

The situation had become bizarre as local government representatives were unavailable or on the run because of their political affiliation after the ouster of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League regime in a student-people upsurge earlier in the month. That made it difficult for relief coordination, local media reports had said.

The floods had hit the country as interim government's Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus was overhauling the bureaucracy by changing their heads.

The New Indian express,2024-09-13 00:00:00,India must rally around eternal spirit of Netaji's INA for another emancipation,"The recently released Tamil movie Indian 2: Zero Tolerance once again ignited the mojo of the Indian National Army and its charismatic leader Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the popular imagination. Kamal Haasan reprised his role as Senapathy, an aging INA veteran and a die-hard Netaji fan who turns into a vigilante to fight against the social malady of corruption. But the missing point in the movie is that individual vigilantism is not the essence of the INA and Netaji. The true INA spirit is an admixture of collective heroism, patriotism, political optimism, self-sacrifice, communal amity and gender equality.

The INA saga is a unique and unparalleled episode not only in India's history but in world history as well. Netaji and his INA resemble the Greek legend of dare-devilish Phaethon who braved to run the Sun Chariot to prove his divine paternity.

MC Setalvad, India's foremost jurist, commented on the Indian National Army and its historic Red Fort trial: ""To the ordinary citizen it was the fascinating and inspiring story of a heroic effort, the most famous in Indian history -- of a great Indian patriot, supported by thousands of his countrymen, to liberate their country.""

King or the country?

The INA Samurais were exceptionally idealistic and committed to their inspiring core principles.

During the INA trials, Captain Shah Nawaz Khan stated: ""The question before me was the King or the country. I decided to be loyal to my country and gave my word of honour to Netaji that I would sacrifice myself for her sake.""

Subhas Chandra Bose infused highly needed optimism during the darkest hours of the nation. Exactly two years before the Independence, on August 15, 1945, he said: ""Never falter in your faith in India's destiny. There is no power on earth that can keep India enslaved. India shall be free and before long.""

Even his last words were highly inspiring and sanguine: ""I feel that I shall die soon. I have fought for India's freedom until the last. Tell my countrymen ""India will be free before long"". Long live Free India!""

Netaji never compromised India's independence despite Japan's military support to the INA. He got an assurance from Prime Minister General Hideki Tojo that Japan was firmly resolved to extend all means to expel and eliminate from India the Anglo-Saxon influence which was the enemy of Indian people, and enable India to achieve full independence in the true sense of the term.

Netaji declared that “Any liberation of India secured through Japanese sacrifices is worse than slavery” (quoted by Shah Nawaz Khan in his My Memories of the INA and its Netaji). Subhas Chandra Bose declared the Provisional Government of Azad Hind on 21 October 1943 styling himself 'Head of the State, Prime Minister and Minister for War and Foreign Affairs'.

Henceforth, the INA became a state army. Netaji's oath as the Head of Azad Hind Government concluded with these words: ""Even after freedom, I will always be prepared to shed even the last drop of my blood for the preservation of India's freedom.""

United in a divided India

Rash Behari Bose, Netaji's John the Baptist, sent epistles to the Indian patriarchs in 1943 seeking their blessings for the nascent INA.

In his letter to Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Rash Behari wrote: ""At present, as the President of the Muslim League, you are looked up to, at home and abroad, as the leader of the vast masses of Indian Muslims. Alas, I am reluctant to consider you as the sole leader of only a section, however big and important it may be. In my eyes, you are the same old Jinnah of years ago, who thought, spoke, and moved as one of the leaders of the entire Indian nation...India can never be India for Indians unless her sons, Hindus and Muslims, begin to identify service to the nation with service to their respective Gods...On behalf of the Indians living in East Asia, I assure you that we are all awaiting your emergence once again as a National Leader.""

This letter highlights the INA leader's optimistic quest for a secular and inclusive India where the leaders would rise above parochial communal politics, even though the country was then entangled in a communal division and a strife-ridden milieu.

Subhas Chandra Bose and the INA always stood for an inclusive, plural, and secular India. This catholicity was palpable in the selection of the National Anthem of the Azad Hind Government. Shubh Sukh Chain, a Hindustani song based on Rabindranath Tagore's Bengali poem Bharoto Bhagyo Bidhata, was the national anthem of the Azad Hind Government. Vande Mataram was sung at the proclamation of the Azad Hind Government in Singapore in October 1943.

However conceding the Muslim feelings against Vande Mataram, Netaji opted for the Hindustani version of Tagore's poem as the National Anthem. The translation, Shubh Sukh Chain, was written by Mumtaz Hussein and Captain Abid Hasan Safrani, and its score composed by Captain Ram Singh Thakur. It took Vande Mataram's place as the official national anthem of the Azad Hind Government and was sung at all meetings, including at the final assembly before Bose's departure.

The role played by women in the INA saga was also remarkable. The Rani of Jhansi Regiment was raised on 12 July 1943 exclusively for the women combatants. Led by Captain Lakshmi Swaminathan, cadets of the Regiment underwent military and combat training with drills, route marches as well as weapons training in rifles, hand grenades, and bayonet charges.

Some 200 of the cadets were also chosen for nursing training, forming the Chand Bibi Nursing Corps. Besides Captain Lakshmi and Janaky Athi Nahappan, Lieutenant Bharati 'Asha' Sahay was an inspiring Amazon of the INA. Asha-san was the daughter of Netaji’s trusted lieutenant Anand Mohan Sahay. At the tender age of 17, she travelled from Japan via Taiwan to Thailand to join the Rani of Jhansi Regiment. Her War Diary is a deeply moving first-hand account of the patriotism and heroism of the INA.

Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in his electrifying October 21, 1943 speech underlined the values of heroism and self-sacrifice for the nation's emancipation: ""In the name of God, in the name of bygone generations who have welded the Indian people into one nation, and in the name of the dead heroes who have bequeathed us a tradition of heroism and self-sacrifice, we call upon the Indian people to rally around our banner and strike for India’s freedom.""

The unwavering idealism, patriotism, and heroism of the INA warriors have gained greater relevance in today's dystopic India. Today's Indian republic, marred by self-seeking, corruption and parochialism, must rally around the sacrosanct and eternal INA spirit for the nation’s emancipation again.
","Indian 2: Zero Tolerance revives Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's legacy and the Indian National Army (INA), emphasizing collective heroism and patriotism over individual vigilantism. Bose rejected foreign aid for India's independence, prioritizing a united, inclusive nation. The INA's ethos included secularism and gender equality, highlighted by the Rani of Jhansi Regiment, showcasing women's significant contributions. In today's politically fragmented India, the INA's values of idealism and self-sacrifice remain crucial, calling for a revival of its spirit to achieve true national emancipation.

The Indian Express ,2024-08-29 00:00:00,Cricket West Indies CEO gives reasons for Jay Shah’s ICC elevation,"Jay Shah’s success in pulling off lucrative broadcast deals and organising major events was the prime reason for the BCCI secretary getting unanimous support in his bid to become the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) new Independent Chair.

“The ICC board doesn’t want to waste too much time on internal politics. If you look at Jay’s leadership at the BCCI, it has been wonderful. He has hosted the Women’s Premier League, successfully oversaw the 50-over World Cup in India and has signed huge broadcast deals with IPL and for BCCI,” Cricket West Indies CEO Johnny Grave told The Indian Express.

That would explain Shah being elected unopposed on Tuesday, with 15 of the 16 directors backing his candidature in the nomination stage. It is the sort of backing not even Jagmohan Dalmiya, Sharad Pawar, N Srinivasan or Shashank Manohar enjoyed at the ICC.

The foremost reason seems to be the uncertainty around the broadcast deal with Disney Star that has cast a shadow over plans for a dedicated fund for Test cricket. Shah, the England Cricket Board and Cricket Australia have been behind the initiative that could guarantee Test cricketers from other countries a match fee of $10,000. Although the economics of it are being worked out, unless ICC sorts out the issues with broadcast partner Disney Star, the plan could be a non-starter.

“We are talking about the Indian sub-continent rights holder, who contributes the major chunk of the revenue. We have seen Jay pull off lucrative deals for IPL and bilateral cricket. It is the need of the hour at the ICC as well,” a board member privy to developments pointed out.

Disney Star is currently in talks with the ICC to reduce its $3billion commitment made for four years that ends in 2027. Any such revision could have an immediate effect on the prospective Test match fund that could be worth around Rs 125 crore. According to this plan, this amount will cover the match fees, touring costs and operational costs for boards outside the Big 3.

“I don’t see the Test match fund coming until the next Future Tours Programme that starts in 2027,” Grave said. “Unless a new economic model is worked out, it would be challenging to bring it now. A lot is riding on the broadcast deal.”

For the plan to get the green light before 2027, there are talks of converting the Champions Trophy which is currently played in the ODI format into a T20 tournament. Shah’s role in this could well be crucial as he has repeatedly stressed on finding a balance between T20s and keeping Test cricket healthy.

“From whatever I read of Jay after taking charge, he seems to acknowledge the issues. It is a good sign because I can see a strategic approach from the ICC, especially with the Olympics coming up. The game has strived for unity and you need everyone aligned on complex issues,” Grave said.

“Outside of England and Australia, broadcasters value only the shorter forms. A dedicated Test match fund would send a message that the format remains the pinnacle even among players. There is a lot of migration happening towards T20s. I certainly believe the Test cricket fund will help other boards to operate cricket efficiently.”

Pressing issues
More than the Test fee for cricketers, the “touring fee” could be the game-changer for member boards. Recently, the ECB announced that it would be paying Zimbabwe for touring England in 2025. It is understood that Shah wants a similar arrangement in place for others, a reason why he wants the dedicated Test match fund to be Rs 125 crore or higher. Needless to say, it has found the backing of member boards.
At present when it comes to bilateral series, host countries walk away with all the revenue. Touring teams getting a fee would increase their revenue extensively, especially when they tour India, England and Australia.

“For member boards, hosting matches and touring costs a lot. And it is not just Test cricket. For example, our first-class system costs $5billion and those are losses. If the current model is changed, boards will be able to invest in players, develop them and refine them. That is where a lot of boards struggle. An appropriate model has to be found,” Grave added.

The need to prioritise Test cricket is among the reasons member boards reckon Shah would be crucial. After he took charge as BCCI secretary, despite the packed calendar, India has played bilateral series with all full-member nations except Pakistan. Over the last 12 months, the BCCI has sent its T20 team to Ireland and Zimbabwe and even hosted Afghanistan at home. It is an aspect where England and Australia often fall short. And Shah did all of it while still prioritising Test cricket as he also announced new incentives for India’s long- format players.","Jay Shah, the BCCI secretary, was unanimously elected as the ICC's new Independent Chair due to his successful leadership at the BCCI. He has secured lucrative broadcast deals, organized major events, and championed a dedicated fund for Test cricket. However, the fund's realization depends on resolving issues with the broadcast partner, Disney Star. Shah's role in promoting Test cricket and ensuring a balanced approach to different formats is crucial for the ICC's future.",Sports,73,809

It has been decided that at least one team from these forces will mandatorily participate in international and national tournaments, he added. “A committee under the chairmanship of the director of the Intelligence Bureau has been constituted and a roadmap has been prepared. We will soon present a new model,” the Minister said. Shah also underlined that forces like the NDRF should ensure that the policy of “zero casualty” during disasters is followed and no lives are lost during calamities.
 
“We have come a long way... The Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been working on the concept of zero casualties during disasters for the last 10 years,” he said. Shah said his Government has allocated higher funds for capacity building and training of the NDRF and State disaster response forces by allocating Rs 2 lakh crore during 2014-24 as compared to Rs 66,000 crore during 2004-14. He complimented the NDRF team for the successful expedition, saying such exercises will boost the force’s capabilities and morale and it will be able to do better during disasters and accident operations. Shah cautioned the rescuers that they should not rest on their laurels but keep improving. The NDRF was raised in 2006 as a federal contingency and disaster response force and at present, has a strength of more than 18,000 men and women rescuers deployed across the country as part of 16 battalions and 28 RRCs. It undertakes operations to mitigate and combat man-made and natural disasters like earthquakes, floods and train accidents among others.","The Union Government approved a 40% hardship and risk allowance for NDRF rescuers, benefiting all 16,000 personnel, as announced by Union Home Minister Amit Shah. This approval follows the successful Mt. Manirang expedition by a 35-member NDRF team. Shah also emphasized the government's focus on zero casualties during disasters and enhancing the capabilities of disaster response forces with increased funding and training.",National News,62,459

According to a PTI report, the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) officials visited sites around the Sanjay Gandhi memorial in the Rashtriya Smriti Sthal and identified some spots where a memorial could come up. The government has started the process of identifying a site for setting up a memorial to former prime minister Manmohan Singh and is in touch with his family to finalise the location.

The government is in touch with Singh's family and has discussed three or four options for the memorial's location, the PTI report quoting sources added.

No site had been finalised yet and everything would be done in consultation with the former prime minister's family. The Centre will set up a trust before allotting the selected land to it for the memorial.

The government has already conveyed its willingness to set up a memorial to the former prime minister's family, the report added. BJP-Cong war of words over Manmohan Singh funeral
A war of words had erupted with the Congress accusing BJP of insulting Manmohan Singh by holding his last rites at Delhi's Nigambodh Ghat.

“The great son of India and the first Prime Minister of the Sikh community, Dr. Manmohan Singh ji has been totally insulted by the present government by performing his last rites today at the Nigambodh Ghat,” Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi posted on X.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra too hit out at the Centre, saying,""By not providing an adequate place for the cremation of former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, the Government has not done justice to the dignity of the post of former Prime Minister, the personality of Manmohan Singh, his legacy and the self-respecting Sikh community.""

The BJP hit back at Congress, accusing it of playing politics over Manmohan Singh.

Union minister and BJP chief JP Nadda said,""It's very unfortunate that former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and incumbent Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge are not refraining from playing politics even over the former prime minister's sad demise.""

""No amount of condemnation is enough for such cheap thinking of the Congress. The Congress, which never gave real respect to Manmohan Singh when he was alive, is now playing politics in the name of his respect,"" he added.","The Indian government has initiated the process of identifying a site for a memorial dedicated to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who passed away last Thursday.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"US flags lowered to half-staff for Jimmy Carter, sparking response from Trump","US flags have been ordered to fly at half-staff in honour of the late President Jimmy Carter, who passed away at the age of 100 on Sunday.

This action was taken by President Joe Biden, in line with the US flag code, which mandates the flag be lowered for 30 days following the death of a current or former president. Flags will remain lowered until January 28.

The decision has raised tensions with former President Donald Trump, who expressed frustration that flags would be flown at half-staff during his inauguration on January 20. “Nobody wants to see this,” Trump wrote on social media, criticising the situation. “Let’s see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre stated that Biden would not reconsider the flag order, which was put in place to honour Carter, as reported by Associated Press (AP).

Under the US flag code, flags are also flown at half-staff to commemorate the deaths of other notable figures, such as vice presidents, Supreme Court justices, and members of Congress, although these periods are shorter.

While the flag order is typically not adjustable, it can be overridden by the president once they are in office. Trump has exercised this power before. In 1973, President Richard Nixon raised the flags before the usual 30-day mourning period was over, to honour the return of American POWs from Vietnam, despite them having been lowered after President Lyndon Johnson’s death.

In previous years, Trump has also faced criticism over his handling of flag protocol. For example, in 2018, following the death of Senator John McCain, the US flag was briefly raised to full height before being lowered again after public backlash.

The flag code remains a symbolic act of national mourning, with the President, governors, and the mayor of Washington, DC holding the authority to order it lowered.
","Following the death of former President Jimmy Carter at age 100, U.S. flags have been ordered to fly at half-staff until January 28, as per the U.S. flag code, which mandates this gesture for 30 days after the passing of a current or former president. President Joe Biden made this decision, but it has sparked tension with former President Donald Trump, who criticized the timing of the flag lowering, given that it coincides with his inauguration on January 20. Although Biden’s office has confirmed that the order will stand, Trump's past actions, such as overriding similar protocols, highlight the flexibility within the flag code. While half-staff orders are typically brief for notable figures like vice presidents or Supreme Court justices, they are subject to presidential authority.",International News,126,309

To be sitting on two big centuries from as many Tests, knowing that at least two more innings remain against his favourite opposition? To be aware that he has got into their heads and under their skin, he has thrown them off their equilibrium, that he has repeatedly looked them in the eye and forced them to blink each time?

What must it feel like to be Travis Head right now, secure in the knowledge that his top-order batters leave ego inside the dressing room and walk out armed with smarts? That they aren’t trying to bash Jasprit Bumrah out of the attack but tire him out selflessly so that the pretty stroke-makers that come a little lower down can have a ball?","Travis Head is likely feeling confident and accomplished, given his impressive performances in recent Tests, including back-to-back centuries. His ability to dominate against strong opposition and take control of their bowlers, particularly someone like Jasprit Bumrah, showcases his mental toughness and strategy. Head's approach reflects not just individual brilliance but also an understanding of the team dynamics. His top-order batting approach is selfless, aiming to tire out key bowlers, which helps the more flamboyant stroke-makers lower down the order.

England's Harry Brook and Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan saw significant advancements, while former Pakistan captain Babar Azam experienced a decline in his ranking. India's Rohit Sharma continues to hold the title of the highest-ranked Indian Test batter, while Ravichandran Ashwin retains his position as the number-one Test bowler.

Babar Azam's recent struggles with the bat have resulted in a sharp drop in the ICC Test rankings, with the Pakistani player slipping six places to ninth, now holding 734 points. Azam's lackluster performance in the first Test of the home season, where he scored a duck in the first innings and just 22 runs in the second, contributed to Pakistan's 10-wicket defeat. On the other hand, Mohammad Rizwan's exceptional batting display, which included an unbeaten 171 and a half-century, propelled him seven places up to 10th in the rankings.

Azam's decline has opened up opportunities for Virat Kohli and Yashasvi Jaiswal to climb the rankings, despite not having played a Test match in months. Interestingly, Kohli, who did not participate in the England series, still manages to outrank Babar, alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal. Kohli has surpassed Azam in the rankings without having played a single Test match since January 2024, now occupying the eighth spot with 737 rating points, narrowly ahead of Babar, who trails by just three points at ninth place.Mushfiqur Rahim's outstanding performance, particularly his remarkable 191 in Bangladesh's historic Test victory, has propelled him to a career-best ranking, jumping seven places to 17th. His impressive display has earned him a new peak in the rankings. Meanwhile, Joe Root maintains his top position in the Test batter rankings following England's victory against Sri Lanka.

In the same match, Harry Brooks delivered an impressive performance, scoring 56 and 32, which has elevated him to fourth place in the rankings. It is worth noting that Brooks has surpassed renowned batters such as Babar Azam, Steve Smith, and Rohit Sharma, thanks to his exceptional recent form.

The Hindu,2024-09-14 00:00:00,U.T. govt. on course to roll out distribution of free rice to ration cardholders,"Speaker R. Selvam and Minister for Civil Supplies P.R.N Thirumurugan have clarified that the government was on course to reopen rations shops for the distribution of free rice and other essential items in Puducherry. 

“The Lt. Governor and Chief Minister are of the same opinion of distributing free rice through ration shops to beneficiaries. So, there is no need to refer the subject to the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Finance Department has already given its concurrence to roll out the scheme to distribute rice instead of remitting money into the beneficiary account. The government is in the process of inviting tenders for procurement of rice for distribution to ration cardholders,” Mr. Selvam said. 

There was no uncertainty on government decision to reopen ration shops, he said adding that the administration was moving ahead with the plan to distribute free rice and other essential items through Public Distribution System outlets. “The administrative process would be completed shortly for the government to invite tender for procurement of rice. We hope to start the tendering process in the next 15 to 20 days. There is no issue regarding reopening of ration shops,” Mr Thirumurugan told The Hindu over phone. 

The response of Mr. Selvam and Mr. Thirumurugan were sought after former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy at a press conference on Friday expressed doubts about the renewal of the scheme as scheduled by the government. 

Mr Narayanasamy had stated that the distribution of free rice would need the approval of Union Government as the Direct Benefit Transfer of cash was adopted by the Puducherry government in lieu of distribution of rice through ration shop at the behest of MHA.

Mr. Thirumurugan said the ration shops were closed during the time of previous Congress government. “Because they (Congress government) messed up everything, the ration shops were closed. Now, we are in the process of reopening the shops. Probably, the former Chief Minister was speaking without knowing the facts,” he added.

During the budget session of the Assembly, Chief Minister N. Rangasamy and the Speaker have announced the government’s intent to distribute free rice and essential items through PDS outlets. The ration shops were closed in Puducherry after differences of opinion emerged between former Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy and the then Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi during the regime of Congress government.

As differences emerged between the elected government and the then Lt. Governor, the subject was referred to MHA. The MHA then concurred with the decision of the Lt. Governor to adopt DBT mode for the free rice scheme in the Union Territory.","Puducherry’s government confirmed plans to reopen ration shops for distributing free rice and essentials, dismissing the need for Union approval.

Wars are causing enormous pain, suffering and displacement. Inequalities and divisions are rife — fueling tensions and mistrust,” Guterres said on Monday.

He said that the globe has just endured a decade of deadly heat and the top ten 10 hottest years on record have happened in the last 10 years, including 2024. “This is climate breakdown — in real-time,” Guterres stressed. “We must exit this road to ruin — and we have no time to lose.”

The UN Chief urged countries to put the world on a safer path by dramatically slashing emissions, and supporting the transition to a renewable future. “It is essential and it is possible,” he added.

“Even in the darkest days, I’ve seen hope power change,” Guterres said, hailing the activists raising their voices for progress, as well as the humanitarian heroes overcoming enormous obstacles to support the most vulnerable people. The UN Chief said he also sees hope in developing countries fighting for financial and climate justice, reports Xinhua news agency.

He underscored that the Pact for the Future, adopted in September, ‘is a new push’ to build peace through disarmament and prevention, reform the global financial system, and stick to the values and principles enshrined by human rights, international law and the United Nations Charter, Xinhua news agency reported.

“There are no guarantees for what’s ahead in 2025. But I pledge to stand with all those who are working to forge a more peaceful, equal, stable and healthy future for all people,” Guterres said. “Together, we can make 2025 a new beginning,” the UN chief said. “Not as a world divided. But as nations united.”

It represents a fresh start and is often associated with setting resolutions for self-improvement, leaving behind the past, and looking forward with hope.","UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in his New Year's message, called for 2025 to be a ""new beginning,"" acknowledging the struggles of 2024, including wars, climate breakdown, and rising inequalities.

During this time, he is enjoying quality moments with his family. Kohli has been a stalwart of Indian cricket for nearly two decades, earning a reputation as one of the greatest batters of all time. His remarkable journey to the pinnacle of the sport began with the 2008 U-19 World Cup.
Similarly, another talented young top-order batter, Shubman Gill, embarked on his own journey with the U-19 World Cup in 2018. Gill has been touted as the next big star in cricket, and alongside Kohli, they form a formidable duo in the top order.
Recently, a video has surfaced online depicting Kohli criticizing Gill. In the video, Kohli appears to suggest that there is a significant difference between showing promise and achieving legendary status, even drawing comparisons to the iconic Sachin Tendulkar. However, it is important to note that the comments in the video seem to be manipulated and not genuine.
The video has quickly gained traction, with some speculating about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence.

Responding to the clip, a user commented, “I will be half asleep and still know that this is not how Virat talks and this is not even his voice.”
Recently, Shubman Gill acknowledged the high expectations placed upon him as a cricketer. He expressed the difficulty of matching the achievements of cricketing legends such as Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

 “Pressure and expectations…they I think always remain. But what Virat Bhai and Rohit Bhai have achieved, if I look to achieve that or reach that, it will be very difficult for me,” Gill had said ahead of the first T20I against Zimbabwe in Harare.

“Every player has his own goal, where he wants to reach. That is the pressure. If you want to reach where other people have reached, then you have more pressure,” Gill added.

In the most recent ICC rankings, Virat Kohli has ascended two positions to claim the eighth spot, while Rohit Sharma, the captain of India, has slipped to sixth place according to the ICC Test Rankings unveiled on Wednesday.

Accompanying Rohit and Kohli in the top 10 is the promising young talent Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has advanced to seventh place in the rankings.","The news article discusses a viral video where it appears that Virat Kohli, the Indian cricket superstar, has criticized Shubman Gill, a talented young opener on the Indian cricket team.

Business Standard,2024-09-19 00:00:00,Atishi's task: To expedite pending welfare policies before Delhi polls,"When Atishi takes oath as Delhi Chief Minister on September 21, she will enter history books as being only the third woman to accomplish the feat after BJP's Sushma Swaraj and Congress' Sheila Dikshit.
Atishi's elevation to the top post comes at a crucial juncture for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which is looking to return to power in the Delhi Assembly polls early next year as well as for the government, which will have to fast-track pending policies and schemes for public welfare.

The senior leader will have her task cut out after assuming office and will be running against time to ensure implementation of schemes like Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana, Electric Vehicle Policy 2.0 and doorstep delivery of services among others.
 

However, Atishi is not new to rising to such situations. Her induction into the cabinet also happened when the government was going through testing times following the arrest of deputy chief minister and the then Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal's trusted lieutenant, Manish Sisodia last year in excise policy case by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
Atishi, along with Saurabh Bharadwaj, joined the Delhi government following the resignation of Sisodia and Satyendar Jain.
Atishi, 43, took to governance, heading 13 major portfolios in the Kejriwal government, including those of finance, revenue, education and public works department.
Even though Atishi joined AAP in 2013, she stayed in the background working as an adviser to the government on education-related policies and made a foray into electoral politics only in 2019 when she unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha polls from East Delhi against BJP's Gautam Gambhir.
Before venturing into active politics, Atishi dropped her surname Marlena, a portmanteau of Marx and Lenin, since she wanted that her political affiliations should not be misconstrued.
In 2020, Atishi again contested elections, this time the Delhi Assembly polls, and was elected as an MLA from Kalkaji.
The fact that she enjoys the confidence of Kejriwal and Sisodia paved the way for her to succeed Kejriwal.

Atishi's parents Vijay Singh and Tripta Wahi were Delhi University professors. She received her Bachelor's degree in History from Delhi University's St Stephen's College and topped her batch.
She also holds postgraduate degrees in Education and History from the University of Oxford.","Atishi will make history on September 21 as only the third woman to become Delhi's Chief Minister, following Sushma Swaraj and Sheila Dikshit. Her appointment comes as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) prepares for the upcoming Delhi Assembly elections and seeks to implement key policies like the Mukhyamantri Mahila Samman Yojana and Electric Vehicle Policy 2.0. Atishi has a strong political background, having previously managed significant portfolios in the Kejriwal government. Despite facing challenges, including the arrest of her predecessor Manish Sisodia, she has consistently demonstrated leadership skills.

“I’m disappointed. I wanted to play in the tournament, and I wanted to have a chance to go out there and walk out on my own on Centre Court again and give it another go. But I also was only going to do that if I felt like I could be competitive. And I didn’t feel like that today,” Murray said.

The Pioneer,2024-09-29 00:00:00,Gang shootouts on the rise in Delhi,"Poising a serious threat to law and order situation, the national capital witnessed three separate firing incidents linked to escalating extortion bids by notorious gangs in the last 24 hours with the shooters attacking a luxury car showroom, a hotel, and a sweet shop. Fortunately, no injuries were reported in any of the incidents.

While some unidentified shooters targeted a hotel at south Delhi’s Mahilpalpur area early Saturday, some assailants opened fire at a sweets shop in Sultanpur Mor in Nangloi later.

According to a police officer, around 9.30 am on Saturday, two men with their faces covered came on a bike and opened three to four rounds of fire at ‘Roshan Halwai’. No one was injured in the incident but there were some shattered glasses in the shop, the officer said.

 Police suspect the shooting was related to protection money of some gangsters.  After the firing at the sweets shop, a note with “Deepak Boxer Bhai, Ankesh Lakra Bhai and Vishal Bhai” --the names of gangsters -- written on it, police said.  CCTV footage has been collected and a probe was underway, they said.

 Earlier around 2.30 am, two men came on a motorcycle and fired around five to six bullets at the main entrance gate of Impress Hotel in south Delhi.  No one was injured in the incident but some glasses were damaged, police said.  Hotel staff and some guests were present in their rooms when the incident took place. Police has initiated a probe into the case.

The hotel’s receptionist, Khalida said that she was not present during the firing as her shift started in the morning.  She added, “They did not target anyone but they opened fire at the gate. Five to six rounds were fired they and fled,” Khalida said.

This attack is also believed to be part of an extortion attempt to take over the hotel. Last year, the hotel owner had been threatened by a man claiming to be connected to Canada-based gangster Goldie Brar. Brar, along with Lawrence Bishnoi - currently in custody in Gujarat-has been linked to previous high-profile extortion cases, including a shooting outside actor Salman Khan’s Mumbai residence.

On Friday night, three men opened fire at a second hand luxury car show room called Car Street Mini in southwest Delhi’s Naraina, situated just a kilometre away from the Naraina police station. In this case also, no one was injured but the attackers targeted the cars in the showroom. Witnesses reported hearing at least 20 rounds being fired by three men, causing widespread panic.

The shooters fled the scene after damaging four luxury cars - two BMWs, a Mercedes, and a Mini Cooper. They also snatched the phone of a salesman and tossed it 100 meters away from the showroom. A slip reading “Bhau Gang, Since 2020” was found at the site, referencing the notorious gangster Himanshu Bhau, who fled to Portugal in 2022 and is suspected of orchestrating extortion attempts from abroad. The gangster has demanded Rs 5 crore from the owner of the car showroom as protection money, they said.

 According to police, the assailants fired more than two dozen bullets inside and outside the showroom.  In a purported CCTV footage of the incident which was surfaced on social media on Saturday, three men are seen firing at the cars in the showroom.  In the video, a shooter is also seen pointing his gun at a customer and employee sitting inside the showroom. In a similar attack in May, the Fusion Cars showroom in Tilak Nagar was targeted, and Rs 5 crore was reportedly demanded by the Bhau Gang. The gang is primarily involved in extortion, demanding large sums of money from business owners in exchange for protection. Police have identified the three suspects involved in the Naraina shooting and have registered a case.

Know why Mohammed bin Salman fears he could be killed,"Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has expressed concerns about the personal risks he may face as he pursues a major diplomatic agreement involving the United States and Israel. This deal could lead to the normalisation of relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. According to a report by Politico, the Crown Prince shared these worries privately with US lawmakers, indicating that moving forward with such a plan could put his life in danger.

He referred to the case of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, who was assassinated in 1981 after signing a peace treaty with Israel. This comparison highlights his fears of facing similar threats. The ongoing conflict in Gaza has added to his concerns, as anger toward Israel grows in the Arab world.

Despite these risks, the Crown Prince is determined to continue the diplomatic process. The report suggests that he is fully aware of the dangers but remains focused on advancing the agreement. 

The deal, still under development, involves significant commitments from the US, including security guarantees, support for a civilian nuclear program, and economic investments. In return, Saudi Arabia would limit its relations with China and establish ties with Israel.

However, there have been challenges, particularly with Israel's reluctance to include a clear path to a Palestinian state in the agreement.

The Pioneer ,2024-07-24 00:00:00,Harnessing the Power of Optimism,"The corporate world is a maze of challenges, deadlines, and pressures that often leave an employee drained and disheartened. However, amidst this complex and mostly daunting environment, there lies a strong antidote: optimism. That very saying, ""The whole world runs on hope,"" has within itself a very deep message that can turn around professional life and make it work wonders. Optimism, not pessimism, is not some feel-good philosophy but a very practical way to build resilience, increase productivity, and foster a more positive workplace culture. Long-term optimism is the positivity of thinking toward the occurrence of good things and ultimately positive results from our efforts.

This mindset should be at the core of every working principle in a corporate setting. Projects may fail, market conditions may go for a toss, or other obstacles might impede; it is then that the optimist who views these obstacles not as insurmountable barriers but as opportunities for growth and learning.

Consider its effect on workplace morale. The optimistic frame of mind can make a lot of difference in the general feel of an office. If leaders or team members have bright, twinkling eyes and a positive outlook, this no doubt will breed others to emulate and follow in their footsteps, creating an upward spiral of sentiments. This sort of collective optimism yields openness to collaboration, increasing innovation, and a willingness to take calculated risks. A team that believes in the possibility of success is going to realize it far more than one that is bogged down in doubt and negativity.Optimism allows for an increase in resiliency. When faced with setbacks, an optimistic person is more likely to try again and views these failures as being transitory, or conquerable.

This elasticity can prove particularly useful in business circles where preservations are often what distinguish between giving up and breaking through to success. In its instance, the optimistic approach will make individuals keep themselves motivated and move consistently toward their goals, even when the odds are not favourable. Even so, optimism needs to strike a correct and delicate balance with realism. Blind optimism that is not based on the real situation brings over-optimistic expectations with a sense of subsequent disappointment. The key here is to adopt realistic optimism: know the challenges, and uncertainties, but emphasise solving the problems and cultivating the outcomes. This balanced approach will keep one hopeful without losing sight of practical considerations.","In the corporate world, optimism serves as a crucial antidote to the challenges, deadlines, and pressures employees face. It enhances resilience, productivity, and workplace morale by encouraging individuals to view obstacles as growth opportunities. Optimistic leaders and team members foster a positive culture, leading to increased collaboration, innovation, and a willingness to take risks.

Incidentally, Diana Pundole, who celebrated her 28th birthday on Friday last, said “But I didn’t touch my phone because I wanted to focus on this weekend’s races. I can’t describe the feelings now, but I’m very happy, of course”.

Businessman from Lonavla Dhruv Chavan survived massive battles through six races over the weekend to win the championship in the Polo Cup.

Jaden could not add to his eight wins, as he finished second behind Bengaluru’s Chetan Surineni in both MRF Formula 2000 races today. However, the 17-year-old Jaden accrued sufficient points to annex his maiden championship with Surineni in second spot on the leaderboard. “I have proved to myself that I have it in me to win a championship.

Responding to questions during a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO Summit, Biden said that no poll or person is telling him that he can't win reelection currently.
That is the only way he would consider ending his presidential bid.
""I'm determined on running,"" he said.
""The fact is that the consideration is that I think I'm the most qualified person to run for president. I beat him (Trump) once and I will beat him again. Secondly.. The idea that senators and congressmen are running for office worrying about the ticket is not unusual and I might add, there were at least five presidents running or incumbent presidents who had lower numbers than I have now later in a campaign,"" Biden said.
""So there's a long way to go in this campaign and so I'm just going to keep moving, keep moving,"" he said.
""And because look, I got more work to do. We've got more work to finish. We made so much progress. Think about where we are economically relative to the rest of the world. Name me a world leader who wouldn't want to trade places with our economy. We created over 800,000 manufacturing jobs, so things are moving. We've got more to go,"" the president said.
""Working class people still need help. Corporate greed is still at large. Corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic. They're coming down and so I'm optimistic about where things are going,"" he asserted.
Biden added that he is seeking his re-election not for his legacy.
""I'm in this to complete the job I started. As you recall, understandably, many of you and many economists thought my initial initiatives that I put forward can't do that because it's going to cause inflation. Things are going to skyrocket. The debt's going to go up. What are you hearing now from mainstream economists?""
""Sixteen economic Nobel laureates said I've done a hell of a job, that under my plan so far and what's going to happen in the future, if I'm reelected, that things are going to get much better. Our economy is growing. I was determined when I got elected to stop the trickle down economic theory that if the wealthy did very well, everybody else would do well,"" the president said.
""I'm not anti-corporate, but corporate profits have doubled since the pandemic, doubled. It's time things get back in order a little bit. It's time. For example, if I'm reelected, we're going to make sure that rents are kept at a five percent increase of corporate rents for apartments and the like and homes are limited to five percent,"" he said.
Biden refuted reports that he told his aides that he needed to go to bed earlier and end meetings around eight in the evening.
""That's not true what I said was, instead of my every day starting at seven and going to bed at midnight, it'd be smarter for me to pace myself a little more. And I said, for example, the 8:00, 7:00, 6:00 stuff, instead of starting the fundraiser at 9:00, start at 8:00. People get to go home by 10:00. That's what I'm talking about,"" he said.
When asked about what changed his mind when in 2020 he said that he would be the bridge candidacy for a younger, fresher generation of Democratic leaders, Biden said: ""What changed was the gravity of the situation I inherited in terms of the economy, our foreign policy and domestic division.","US President Joe Biden on Thursday said he is ""determined"" and ""fit"" to seek his re-election against his Republican rival Donald Trump.

The exports in value terms were up 75 per cent in September and 50 per cent in the nine-month period and are already higher than the entire shipments in 2023 by 25 per cent.

Between January and mid-October this year, the country exported Rs 11948 crore worth of coffee against Rs 7950 crore in the same period last year and Rs 9555 crore for the entire year of 2023, as per the data of Coffee Board.
“The smaller crop in Brazil and Vietnam saw international coffee prices almost doubling this year. This saw the export value increasing by 50 per cent while the volumes went up only by 15.6 per cent,” said Ramesh Rajah, president, Coffee Exporters Association. Arabica prices in the international market have gone up to 250 cents per pound against 140 cents last year and Robusta prices are up to $4700 per tonne against $2400 last year
Further, European Union’s deforestation regulations for coffee production were earlier announced to be implemented from January 1, 2025. This made exporters frontload their produce to the European markets. The largest markets for Indian coffee this year are Italy and Germany and the European countries have contributed almost 40 per cent of the purchases.

“However, the implementation of the regulations has been postponed by one year and hence we would see some moderation in shipments to these countries going ahead. Though Indian coffee planters will not be affected by the regulations per se, the paperwork and processes involved in proving compliance is cumbersome,” said Raja.

While the exports have been increasing this year, the production has been stagnant. This along with the higher international rates saw coffee prices in the Indian market going up by Rs 100 per kg over the previous year.","India's coffee exports surged by 75% in September and 50% over nine months, driven by rising international prices and frontloading ahead of the EU's deforestation regulations set for 2025.

The approval was given after a meeting by the authority on Friday.

The MMRDA, under the leadership of metropolitan commissioner Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, will utilise bonds as a fund-raising mechanism. Earlier, the MMRDA relied solely on borrowings and land monetisation.

A senior official revealed that the initial amount to be raised will be based on immediate requirements, potentially starting with Rs 10,000 crore and gradually increasing to meet the maximum requirement.



At present, the MMRDA is engaged in several mega infrastructure projects worth several lakh crores. To finance these, it has borrowed funds from various financial institutions and depended significantly on land monetisation.

The official noted that raising money through bonds would alleviate the need to sell land at lower prices to meet funding needs.

The official also highlighted that MMRDA’s strong credit score and valuable assets in prime locations, including Bandra Kurla Complex, make bonds an attractive option for raising funds.

With the approval in place, MMRDA will now begin the process through an underwriter to gauge market response and proceed with listing accordingly.

The Orissa Post,2024-10-12 00:00:00,Dhak and dhakis steal the show in festive season,"Bhubaneswar: The festive season is incomplete without the sound of dhak, huge, almost cylindrical or barrel-shaped membranophone instrument from Bengal and Assam, suspended from the neck, tied to the waist and kept on the lap or the ground, and usually played with wooden sticks. Dhak and dhakis are an integral part of Durga Puja celebrations in the eastern states.

In the Capital city, dhakis from nearby areas including Puri, Cuttack and Jagatsinghpur are usually hired by the puja committees, to elevate the festive mood and pull in crowds. The festive season helps the dhakis earn some extra money, apart from their regular engagement in odd jobs and daily wage labourers, and sometimes migrant workers, for earning a livelihood.

A few of them are also year-round farmers, who have access to agricultural land. Subrat Kumar Nayak from Niali in Cuttack districts said he has been continuously coming to Bhubaneswar for the last 15 years with his family to play dhak. “Our forefathers used to play dhaks full-time, but nowadays we only play it during the festive season,” he said. “We are engaged in cultivation to run the family. We generally earn decent amount during the festive season. This is a seasonal occupation for us but it helps us to earn a little more,” Nayak said. Similarly, Narendra Nayak of Sailagobindapur in Cuttack said, “Playing dhak for Durga Maa during the festival has been a traditional occupation of our family for several years, but now, our future generation is not interested in continuing the tradition.

However, I will continue to play till my last breath.” Basant Samal, a sehnai player from Jagatsinghpur, said they are small artistes who depend upon these festivals and ceremonies for their livelihood. “We are only remembered during the marriage functions, thread ceremonies and festival season,” he said. “Durga Puja is a festival of sharing happiness. The dhakis come from far-off places, leaving their family away during the festival to work and perform in different pandals. They look forward to the festival season with huge expectations,” said Sachinandan Nayak, secretary of Saheed Nagar Durga Puja Committee. Being a full-time dhak player is not stable. Most dhakis choose alternative ways of income to support themselves and their families. Dhakis have to stay away from their families during the festive season because of their job, and they have been doing it every year. While everyone dances to the beat of dhak, which indeed invokes the aura of Durga puja, the dhakis make a silent sacrifice","Dhak players, or dhakis, are an integral part of Durga Puja celebrations in eastern India, especially in cities like Bhubaneswar. Traditionally, dhakis come from nearby regions such as Puri, Cuttack, and Jagatsinghpur to perform during the festival, earning extra income beyond their usual livelihoods as farmers, laborers, or migrant workers. Many dhakis have inherited the tradition from their forefathers, but younger generations are less interested in continuing it. Despite this, some, like Subrat Kumar Nayak and Narendra Nayak, remain committed to playing dhak during Durga Puja. Although the work is seasonal, it brings financial relief and is a cultural tradition, even as dhakis sacrifice time with their families to perform and elevate the festive atmosphere.",Obituaries,115,415
The Pioneer,2024-10-12 00:00:00,PM Modi meets Canadian counterpart Justin Trudeau at Laos,"
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Justin Trudeau met on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Laos, almost a year after his Canadian counterpart accused India of involvement in the death of a Canadian Khalistani separatist.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC News) on Friday said Trudeau described the meeting as a “brief exchange” when the two leaders met during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit in Vientiane, Laos held on Thursday.

""I emphasised that there is work that we need to do,"" the CBC News quoted Trudeau as saying.

""I won't go into details about what we talked about but what I've said many times is that the safety of Canadians and upholding the rule of law is one of the fundamental responsibilities of any Canadian government and that's what I'll stay focused on,” Trudeau told a press conference at Vientiane.

The ties between India and Canada were strained last year after Trudeau's allegations in September of a “potential” involvement of Indian agents in Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing outside a gurdwara in Surrey city on June 18, 2023.

India, which had designated Nijjar as a terrorist in 2020, has strongly rejected Trudeau's allegations as “absurd” and “motivated.”

India has been maintaining that the main issue between the two countries is that of Canada giving space to pro-Khalistan elements operating from Canadian soil with impunity.

“We are seeing troubling patterns of violence affecting Indo-Canadians right across the country over the past number of months, and this is an issue that I can assure you that we will continue to be very, very seized with,” Trudeau said.

Trudeau maintained that he stands behind his allegation and said, national security agencies and law enforcement “continue to be deeply engaged on this issue.”

Trudeau's statement comes a day after Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly, while testifying at the Public Inquiry into Foreign Interference on Thursday, called relations with India as “tense” and “very difficult” right now, and added, there's still a threat of more killings like Nijjar's on the Canadian soil.

Joly said she has been pushing India to participate in the Canadian police investigation into Nijjar's death but so far that hasn't happened.

Modi and Trudeau had last met on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy in June this year, their first meeting after Canada raised allegations regarding Nijjar's death.

Modi had then posted an image on social media of the two leaders shaking hands with a one-liner saying “met Canadian PM Justin Trudeau at the G7 Summit”.

Next day, Trudeau said that there was a commitment to work together with India to deal with some “very important issues”.

The Arunachal Front,2024-09-09 00:00:00,Unchecked influx of refugees and illegal immigrants,"Recently, the All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union (AAPSU) appealed to the Arunachal Pradesh government to conduct rigorous checking drives at the state’s various entry points and check gates as an immediate measure to prevent possible influx of illegal immigrants into the state following large-scale violence and the deepening political crisis in Bangladesh.

The state’s apex student body expressed concern that the potential entry of illegal immigrants into Arunachal could disrupt the tribal ecology and the demographic balance of the state.

The state government has also on its part acted promptly and issued strict ILP checking guidelines, which include mandatory police verification. Although these measures have been in place since decades, the influx of illegal immigrants into Arunachal has sadly remained unhindered.

The present situation in our neighbouring country Bangladesh and the neighbouring state of Manipur can only exacerbate the issue of illegal migration into Arunachal. Some districts of the state have witnessed sudden influx of refugees from violence-hit Manipur also.  Though their numbers are less now, it may increase steadily, considering the continuing violence there. With porous international borders and interstate boundaries, Arunachal proves to be a safe haven for the violence-affected refuge seekers and illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, besides neighbouring states like Manipur.

It is a matter of grave concern, but unfortunately governments at both the state and the centre-level seem completely at a loss on this issue. What is concerning is the fact that the government of India till date does not have accurate data regarding the number of illegal immigrants in India.

We have witnessed how the settlement of Chakma and Hajong refugees in Arunachal in the past has led to the present-day political problems in our state. Present-day Arunachalis are still bearing the brunt of the past central government’s historic blunder. We all know how initially few in numbers, the refugee population slowly and gradually increased, using up the local resources for decades. These resources are limited, and with the increase in the population of the indigenous people, these resources would not be enough to sustain both the indigenous and the refugee population in the long run and would only result in possible conflict over them.

Similarly, the present-day influx of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and conflict-ridden neighbouring states should definitely raise serious concerns among the people of Arunachal. Such unchecked influx, small or large, could pose a serious threat to the state’s demography and overburden the limited resources in future.

The people of Arunachal, in search of cheap labour for construction and farm work, often engage illegal immigrants. These efficient and cheap workers have slowly captured the labour, agriculture and related markets in the state with the help and support of the local indigenous people who let them till their land and sometimes lease it to them for a fixed monthly income. Moreover, their slow and gradual assimilation with the local indigenous people through matrimony and other social and economic interactions may also affect the cultural identity and disrupt the state’s demography in the near future.

The Centre and the state must come together and try to resolve the issue with strong political will, along with taking in the confidence of neighbouring states and countries involved, as well. Before it is too late, the government must act promptly to contain the influx of illegal immigrants and refugees in the state, and to preempt any possible clashes of the communities.","The All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union (AAPSU) has urged the state government to intensify checking drives at entry points and ILP check gates to prevent a potential influx of illegal immigrants, particularly from violence-hit Bangladesh and Manipur. The student body expressed concern that the entry of illegal immigrants could disrupt the tribal ecology and demographic balance of Arunachal Pradesh.

Although the government has issued strict ILP guidelines and police verification norms, the influx remains largely uncontrolled, highlighting the ineffectiveness of existing mechanisms. The porous international borders with Bangladesh and Myanmar, and interstate boundaries with Manipur, make Arunachal a safe haven for refugees and illegal migrants.

AAPSU referenced past issues like the Chakma-Hajong refugee crisis, warning that unchecked migration could overburden local resources and spark future conflict. The illegal workforce's integration into local economies and even through marital assimilation may threaten indigenous culture and identity.

AAPSU called for urgent, coordinated efforts by the state and central governments, and engagement with neighbouring states and countries, to prevent long-term socio-political and economic consequences.",Local News,170,569
The Hans India,2024-09-14 00:00:00,Judicial custody of Darshan others extended till Sep 17 ,"Bengaluru: A Bengaluru court on Friday extended the judicial custody of jailed Kannada superstar Darshan, his partner Pavithra Gowda and 15 other accused in the fan murder case till September 17. All the accused lodged in different jails, including Darshan, who is lodged in Ballary prison, were presented to the court of Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) through video conference. The counsel for Darshan is yet to submit the bail plea of the actor before the court.

The Bengaluru Police recently submitted a 3,991-page charge sheet to the court against Darshan, his partner, and 15 other accused in connection with the kidnap and murder of his fan Renukaswamy. Police sources stated Bengaluru Police Commissioner B. Dayananda had recommended placing CCTV cameras at the cell where Darshan is kept in Ballary prison to monitor him and avoid the recurrence of any incident of luxury treatment to him in the prison. Sources revealed that this kind of monitoring will be done for high-profile terrorists inside the prison. Meanwhile, one Venkatachalapathy has submitted a complaint with the Karnataka Lokayukta against the Bengaluru Police alleging that the cops have prepared a charge sheet in favour of actor Darshan with the intention of helping him escape from the clutches of the law. The charge sheet has ‘many loopholes’ and is ‘weak’, alleged Venkatachalapathy and lodged the complaint against the Police Commissioner B. Dayananda, DCP S. Girish and Vijayanagara ACP Chandan Kumar. The complainant has also alleged that in the charge sheet, it was shown that when Darshan went out from the shed, the victim Renukaswamy was alive.

indian express ,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Supreme Court grants bail to Nepali citizen booked under UAPA,"Noting the right to a speedy trial and that “the trial is proceeding at a snail’s pace,” the Supreme Court on Thursday granted bail to Sheikh Javed Iqbal, a Nepali citizen booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), bypassing its stringent bail provision.

The bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and Ujjal Bhuyan noted that Iqbal has been incarcerated for over nine years with the evidence of only two witnesses being recorded in that time.

Significantly, the apex court sidestepped the stringent bail provision under UAPA, which prescribes a finding of not guilty for the grant of bail, and said that “statutory restrictions would not come in the way” if the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21 of the Constitution of India) of the accused has been “infringed”.
This is the third major case where the SC has granted bail despite the UAPA bar against granting bail.

Section 43(D)(5) of UAPA places additional restrictions for granting bail, providing that the public prosecutor must be heard in any bail application and completely barring bail in cases if there are grounds to believe that the accusation is prima facie (on face value) true.","The Supreme Court granted bail to Sheikh Javed Iqbal, a Nepali citizen detained under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for over nine years, citing the right to a speedy trial and the slow pace of proceedings.

Tsering added that “proper restoration and repairing will require huge fund.

“However, I have asked the officer to go ahead with the work for proper restoration, so that people in these areasand several institutions do not get affected due to poor road connectivity,” he added.

Later, he inspected the ongoing construction of the four-lane highway in between Papu Nallah and Naharlagun.

“I have been carrying out inspection one or two days a week to remain updated on the work’s progress. The major setback is the weather condition, which does not allow the work to progress.

The Times of India ,2024-07-12 00:00:00,"100 engineering colleges introduce fresh CS courses, up intake","BENGALURU: At least 100 engineering colleges in the state have received approval to start or increase their intake in computer science or its allied programmes like artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and cyber security for the upcoming years. Some of the colleges have increased their intake in the stream by up to 600 seats.
As per data from the department of higher education, no-objection certificates have been issued for 104 engineering colleges. Among them, at least 100 colleges had sought permission to increase the intake or start programmes related to computer science.
The drastic increase is because All-India Council for Technical Education has removed the cap on the number of seats, subject to availability of infrastructure and faculty. It has allowed merger of some programmes like computer science with information science.
With this, some colleges have increased their seats even by 600. For instance, in BMS College of Engineering, the total number of computer science and engineering seats (merged with information science and engineering) is 1200, up from the earlier 336.

RNS Institute of Technology had 240 seats each for CS and IS. With IS becoming CS and another 120 seats added, the total intake in the programme is now 600.
“CS is the front-runner. Students who do not get CS, usually opt for IS... With AICTE’s new concept to consolidate the courses, we decided to do that,” said Ramesh Babu, principal.
“There is societal demand that students take up CS. There is also the belief that it comes with the best placement offers, which in many cases is true,” explained KN Subramanya, principal, RV College of Engineering.

The fees for management quota seats in RVCE is Rs 68 lakh as against Rs 64 lakh last year. Yet, another course that has gained traction is MBA, with a few colleges starting the course or increasing the number of seats for it.

At the same time, several colleges have sought progressive closure or decrease of intake in undergraduate civil and mechanical engineering programmes.

For instance, Hirasugar Institute of Technology, Belagavi, has got an NOC for the progressive closure of its civil engineering department. MVIT, Bengaluru, has sought a progressive closure for mechanical engineering while introducing CS and allied programmes. Some colleges are also bringing down the curtains on some of their PG programmes. Basaveshwara Engineering College, Bagalkot has sought closure for PG in food biotechnology, defence technology and VLSI and embedded systems.

TOI had reported earlier that as per the draft seat matrix released by the department, total seats in the state had gone up to 1.3 lakh from more than 1.2 lakh last year.


The number of engineering seats available through Common Entrance Test has increased from 58,845 last year to 62,930 this time. More seats could be added in the next rounds of counselling as and when they receive approval from AICTE.

“It's a herd mentality. There is a lot of publicity on the jobs available in CS. But there is very little knowledge on job prospects in streams like civil. But the CS bubble is developing cracks. There are a lot of instances where the offer letters have not materialized for over a year,” said Ali Khwaja, founder, Banjara Academy.


There are 215 colleges under VTU. “AICTE’s new norms removing the cap on the number of seats that can be increased as well as streams to be added, irrespective of NIRF ranking, NAAC accreditations etc has resulted in the increase of seats,” said S Vidyashankar, VC.
","In Bengaluru, over 100 engineering colleges have received approval to expand or introduce computer science and related programs, including AI and data science, with some increasing their intake by up to 600 seats. This surge follows the All-India Council for Technical Education’s removal of seat caps. Some colleges, like BMS College and RNS Institute of Technology, have significantly boosted their CS seats. Concurrently, several institutions are reducing or closing programs in civil and mechanical engineering. The total number of engineering seats in the state has risen from 1.2 lakh to 1.3 lakh, reflecting a shift towards high-demand tech fields.",Education,99,579

The Telegraph,2025-01-01 00:00:00,Santosh: Why Sandhya Suri’s Oscar-shortlisted debut feature film is a must-watch,"Sandhya Suri’s Santosh, shortlisted by The Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences for the 97th Oscars in the best international feature category, is a cinematic exploration of power, caste, and the haunting realities of communal divisions in modern India. The film blends its fiercely feminist narrative with a critical look at the institutional systems that perpetuate inequality. Here’s why Santosh is a must-watch for global audiences.

A complex feminist protagonist in a patriarchal society
At the heart of Santosh is Shahana Goswami’s compelling portrayal of Santosh, a Hindu widow navigating the oppressive labyrinth of institutionalised patriarchy. After inheriting her late husband’s job as a police constable, Santosh dons the khaki uniform, which quickly becomes a metaphor for empowerment.

Santosh is a complex character — a grieving woman slowly absorbing the language and corruption of the police force while grappling with her own biases. The audience’s initial sympathy for her transforms as she becomes enmeshed in the very structures she once resisted. Goswami’s nuanced performance captures this evolution with striking realism, making Santosh a deeply relatable yet unsettling character.
Deconstructing the institutional biases within the police force

In stark contrast to mainstream Bollywood’s glorification of police authority, Santosh dissects the unsettling realities of law enforcement in India. Films like Rohit Shetty’s Cop Universe celebrate vigilante justice and extra-judicial killings, presenting them as heroic acts. Santosh takes a sharply critical stance, exposing how power, especially when combined with caste and religious biases, can turn oppressive and violent.

Through Santosh’s journey, the film critiques the normalisation of police brutality, moral policing, and institutionalised corruption. What starts as an amusing initiation into police culture quickly morphs into a chilling exploration of its darker sides, leaving viewers questioning their own complicity in these societal norms.
A gripping crime drama with social commentary

The murder of a Dalit girl serves as the film’s central plot, drawing attention to India’s deeply entrenched caste system and its impact on justice. When a charismatic senior officer, Inspector Geeta Sharma (played by Sunita Rajwar), steps in to lead the investigation, she mentors Santosh in ways that are both empowering and morally ambiguous.

As the investigation unfolds, Santosh’s inherent caste and religious biases come to the fore. Her aggressive pursuit of a Muslim suspect reflects the societal prejudices that influence even well-meaning individuals. The film forces viewers to confront the chilling fluidity of justice in India, which shifts based on caste, religion, and social status.

A feminist tale that subverts expectations

While Santosh appears to be an empowerment saga, this is merely a façade. The film unpacks the unsettling allure of power and its ability to corrupt even the most well-intentioned individuals. Santosh’s transformation from a grieving widow to a complicit authority figure is both tragic and thought-provoking.

In a pivotal moment, Santosh witnesses police brutality and is horrified — initially. Her subsequent action — taking up the baton and beating the suspect black and blue — reveals a terrifying shift in her, one that mirrors the institutional indoctrination she has undergone.

A visual and emotional experience

Sandhya Suri’s direction ensures that Santosh remains tethered to its protagonist’s perspective. The camera lingers on Santosh during moments of introspection and fury, creating an intimate yet unsettling connection between the character and the audience. This stylistic choice, combined with the apocalyptic portrayal of north India, transforms the film into an academic exploration of societal structures.

While the film lacks clarity about its central case, it compensates by exposing the unsavoury implications of caste and religious hegemony. Its grim tone offers little levity, but this deliberate choice reinforces the weight of its subject matter.","Santosh, directed by Sandhya Suri, is a feminist crime drama critiquing power, caste, and communal biases in India. Shahana Goswami portrays a widow-turned-policewoman grappling with systemic corruption and her evolving complicity. The film exposes police brutality, caste oppression, and societal prejudices, delivering a haunting exploration of justice and institutional indoctrination.",Entertainment,50,601
Deccan Chronicles,2024-07-05 00:00:00,PM Modi to visit Moscow on Monday; a first since Ukraine invasion  ,"Mumbai: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday makes his first visit to Russia since the invasion of Ukraine, walking a fine line between maintaining a longstanding Moscow alliance while courting closer Western security ties. Russia is a key supplier of cut-price oil and weapons to India, but its isolation from the West and growing friendship with China have impacted its time-honoured partnership with New Delhi.
The United States and its Western allies have in recent years cultivated ties with India as a bulwark against Beijing and its growing influence in the Asia-Pacific, while also pressuring it to distance itself from Russia. Modi, who was returned to power last month as leader of the world's most populous country, last visited Russia in 2019 and hosted President Vladimir Putin in New Delhi two years later, weeks before the invasion.

Russia's war in Ukraine has ""transformed"" ties with India, said Swasti Rao, from a think tank funded by India's defence ministry, the Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses. ""There is no decline in goodwill between India and Russia per se,"" she said. ""But there are challenges that have cropped up. ""These are external factors, which have been strong enough to bring in a paradigm shift in India-Russia bilateral issues,"" she added.

Nandan Unnikrishnan of the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation said the upcoming in-person meeting showed the two sides were looking for ways forward. ""There have been pressures on India, and there have been pressures on the India-Russia relationship,"" Unnikrishnan said. ""Face-to-face interactions help in working out positions,"" he added. ""I'm sure Mr Modi would like an assessment from Putin on the Ukraine war.""

Ship has sailed New Delhi has shied away from explicit condemnation of Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and has abstained on United Nations resolutions censuring Moscow. But Russia's war in Ukraine has also had a human cost for India. New Delhi said in February it was pushing Russia to release some of its citizens who had signed up for ""support jobs"" with the Russian military, following reports some were killed after being forced to fight in Ukraine. Moscow's deepening ties with Beijing have also raised concerns for New Delhi. China and India, the world's two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia. India is part of the Quad grouping with the United States, Japan and Australia that positions itself against China's growing assertiveness in the Asia-Pacific region. The United States and the European Union accuse China of selling components and equipment that have strengthened Russia's military industry -- allegations Beijing strenuously denies. That leaves India with a dilemma. Their ""relationship has to evolve"", said Rao. ""Some say India should strongly engage with Russia so it doesn't fall into the lap of China,"" said Rao. ""Others would say, that ship has sailed."" New Delhi and Moscow have forged a tight relationship since the Cold War, and Russia was for a long time India's biggest arms supplier. But Ukraine has stretched Russia's arms supplies, and India is eyeing other sources -- including growing its own defence industry. Russia's share of Indian imports of weapons has shrunk considerably in recent years, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). It dropped from 76 percent in 2009-13 to 36 percent in 2019-23, SIPRI said, noting France is now a close second, providing 33 percent. ""India has instead looked to Western suppliers, most notably France and the USA, and its own arms industry,"" SIPRI said, adding that its arms procurement plans ""seemingly do not include any Russian options"". Arms down, oil up Rao said the Ukraine war had ""accelerated"" India's push to diversify its defence purchases. ""The Ukraine war has become one of grinding attrition,"" she said. ""There are genuine concerns about Russia's export capabilities, and its focus and priorities."" At the same time, India has also become a major buyer of discounted Russian oil, providing a much-needed export market for Moscow after it was cut off from traditional buyers in Europe. That has dramatically reshaped energy ties, with India saving itself billions of dollars while bolstering Moscow's war coffers. India's month-on-month imports of Russian crude ""increased by eight percent in May, to the highest levels since July 2023"", according to commodity tracking data compiled by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. ""Russian crude comprised 41 percent of India's total crude imports in May, and with new agreements in place to conduct payments in rubles, the trade might grow significantly,"" the research centre said. But this has also resulted in India's trade deficit with Russia rising to a little over $57 billion in the past financial year. From Moscow, Modi will travel to Vienna for the first visit to the Austrian capital by an Indian leader since Indira Gandhi in 1983.
","Indian PM Modi is visiting Russia for the first time since the Ukraine invasion. This trip is significant because India has traditionally been close to Russia but is also building ties with the West. The US wants India to distance itself from Russia, but India relies on Russia for cheap oil and weapons. Russia's war has however caused delays in weapon deliveries and India is looking elsewhere for arms. On the other hand, India has become a big buyer of discounted Russian oil, helping Russia's economy. This visit is a chance for both sides to discuss the future of their relationship.

It is in the choice of the priority areas articulated by the finance minister, especially with respect to youth and employment, that has caught her attention. “While there is a bit of a disappointment that there was no big announcement for building the healthcare sector, it is heartening to note the emphasis on youth and on employment generation,” she says. “The distinct focus on these in the budget makes us all very happy.

""On being inquired by this court about the reasons for arresting the applicant or accused despite his having joined the investigation in compliance with the notice, the IO produced the police file for the perusal of this court, wherein, in the arrest memo, typed reasons were ticked mechanically for arresting the accused without elaborating upon the grounds for invoking those typed reasons,"" said the court.

As many as 10 teams of officials, including those from Revenue, Survey, Forest and Agriculture departments, will carry out the survey under the supervision of special officer J.O. Arun and Additional District Magistrate M.K. Devaki. Each team will survey and mark five hectares. The survey would be completed in five days, officials said.

The area earmarked for the township will exclude sections deemed unsuitable for rehabilitation and construction. However, permission will be granted for plantation activities on lands not designated for resettlement. Once the field survey is finalised, construction activities for the townships will begin.

Considering variations in land valuation, families to be resettled in Elston Estate will receive five cents each, while those in Nedumbala will be allocated 10 cents.

Even after resettlement, land ownership in the disaster-affected areas will remain with the respective individuals, and the land will not go back to government control.

The Pioneer ,2024-07-24 00:00:00,Optimistic outlook,"The Economic Survey for 2023-24 released on the eve of the Union Budget is optimistic about the Indian story of growth and development; however, it also indicates the areas of concern on which it suggests the Central Government to act on priority. It is customary to have the Economic Survey just before the budget as it sets the tone of the budget and puts things in perspective. This year round it is buoyant on growth and pegs India’s GDP growth at 6.5 -7.0 % in this fiscal year. The Economic Survey, a comprehensive report that reviews the developments in the Indian economy over the past year, forecasts robust growth in various sectors. This optimism is grounded in several factors, including strong domestic consumption, increased investments, and favourable government policies. Interestingly this is despite the fact that most economies around the world are struggling to attain much lower levels of GDP. The survey underscores the Government's focus on infrastructure as a critical driver of growth. Ongoing projects in road, rail, and port development are expected to boost connectivity and efficiency, facilitating smoother trade and commerce. Besides, the rapid expansion of the digital economy is another significant area of growth. Though open to criticism, the Survey maintains that the 'Make in India' initiative continues to show promising results.

The survey notes that boosting exports, particularly in high-growth industries such as pharmaceutical, electronics, and textiles, could significantly enhance India's global economic standing. The Survey also talks about the problem area of the Indian economy. Agriculture, the backbone of the Indian economy, remains a priority. The survey recommends further reforms to increase productivity and ensure sustainable growth in this sector. Innovations in technology and better access to markets are crucial to achieving these goals. The Economic Survey rightly numerates various factors which could pull down the economy and be an impediment in the national growth. The biggest stumbling block is of course inflation. The survey suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy to manage inflation without stifling growth. Unemployment yet another constraint needs to be addressed on priority. The survey calls for policies that support skill development and entrepreneurship to harness the potential of the burgeoning young population. PM Modi reaffirmed the government's commitment to fostering an environment conducive to growth. Indeed, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget for 2024-25 incorporates several suggestions made by the Economic Survey. Setting a roadmap for the third term of Modi Government, Union Finance Minister has defined nine priorities. These are agriculture, employment, human development, energy security, manufacturing, innovation, infrastructure and next generation reforms. These would indeed go a long way in reducing unemployment, curbing inflation and giving economy a push that would be inclusive and sustainable.","The Economic Survey for 2023-24, released before the Union Budget, is optimistic about India's growth, projecting a 6.5-7.0% GDP increase for the fiscal year.

Key growth drivers include infrastructure projects and the digital economy. The survey highlights areas for improvement, such as boosting exports in high-growth industries, increasing agricultural productivity, and addressing inflation and unemployment.

Deccan Chronicle,2024-10-22 00:00:00,Revanth warns action against hate-mongers,"Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy issued a stern warning to those involved in attacks on religious places, stating that the state government would not spare anyone engaged in such disruptive activities. He asked police to initiate strict action against those inciting communal tensions and disrupting peace and tranquility.

The Chief Minister was addressing the Police Day flag parade at the Police Martyrs Memorial in Goshamahal on Monday. He said that the state government would take swift action if complaints were lodged regarding undesirable incidents and elements responsible for such acts.

In an apparent reference to a recent incident where a crowd in Secunderabad allegedly sought to vandalise a hotel linked to an idol desecration case, Reddy urged the public to avoid taking law into their hands. “If anyone tries to take law into their hands or to punish those who committed a wrong, there will be little difference between them and the culprits,” he said. The police are equipped to deal with offenders and that the public should place their trust in law enforcement, he appealed.

The Chief Minister later laid the foundation stone for a Young India Police School, which will be a residential facility spread over 50 acres at Manchirevula. The school will cater to children of serving police personnel, martyrs' families and other uniformed services, including fire, excise, and prison departments.

Modelled after the National Defence Academy, this institution aims to provide quality education that will be on par with international standards.

The Chief Minister praised the efforts of the state police force, particularly during festivals such as Muharram, Christmas, Ganesh Chaturthi, among others, acknowledging their dedication despite inadequate facilities.

● CM STRESSED that police must adopt a firm stance in dealing with criminals, while maintaining a friendly approach towards victims and the public. “Friendly policing is about having a friendly attitude towards the public, not criminals.”

“Police are not doing their jobs just for salary. They took the responsibility of maintaining law and order,"" he said.

Reddy stressed that police must adopt a firm stance in dealing with criminals, while maintaining a friendly approach towards victims and the general public.

""Friendly policing is about having a friendly attitude towards the public, not criminals,"" he stated.

He highlighted the state’s commitment to maintaining peace and security, while maintaining that these were crucial for attracting investment and fostering the state’s development.

To further enhance law enforcement capabilities, he said that the state government has established an anti-narcotics bureau to curb the spread and use of illegal substances. He also suggested the use of Artificial Intelligence, alongside traditional policing methods, to manage Hyderabad's ever-increasing traffic and enforce regulations more effectively.

As a means to further support the police force, he announced enhanced compensation for police personnel, who lose their lives while on duty. Constables and head constables will be paid compensation of `one crore; SIS and CIS `1.25 crore, DSP rank officials `1.50 crore, while IPS rank officers would be paid `two crore.

Additional provisions include compensation for those who suffer permanent disabilities and jobs to the families of personnel who lose their lives while performing their duties.

The New Indian Express,2024-12-31 00:00:00,"Elon Musk shifts stand on H-1B visas: System broken, needs major reform","DAYS AFTER he said he would “go to war” to defend the H-1B visa programme, Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and a key ally of US President-elect Donald Trump, has said the system is “broken” and needs “major reform”.

The H-1B programme allows businesses in the US to employ skilled foreign nationals.

In response to a post on X, the social media site he owns, Musk said on Sunday that he has “been very clear” that the programme is “broken and needs major reform”.He was responding to a user who said the US needs to be a destination for the “world’s most elite talent”, but the H-1B programme “isn’t the way to do that”.

In his post, Musk said the system can be “easily fixed by raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H-1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically”.

In a series of social media posts late Friday, Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, had vowed to “go to war” to defend the visa programme for foreign tech workers, and asked those opposing it to “take a big step back”.“The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H-1B. Take a big step back… I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,” he had said.

The H-1B visa has become a flashpoint within Trump’s conservative base. While Trump has criticised the H-1B visas in the past, calling them “very bad” and “unfair” for US workers, he supported Musk on Saturday, calling himself a “believer in H-1B” and saying he has “always been in favour of the visas”.“I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favour of the visas. That’s why we have them,” Trump said in a telephone interview with the New York Post on Saturday. “I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great programme,” he said.During his first term as President, Trump unveiled a “Hire American” policy that directed changes to the programme to try to ensure the visas were awarded to the highest-paid or most-skilled applicants. Trump’s hardline immigration policies, focused mostly on immigrants who are in the country illegally, were a cornerstone of his presidential campaign and a priority issue for his supporters.But in recent days, his coalition has split in a public debate, largely taking place online, about the tech industry’s hiring of foreign workers. Hard-right members of Trump’s movement have accused Musk and others in Trump’s new flank of tech-world supporters of pushing policies at odds with Trump’s “America First” vision.

Software engineers and others in the tech industry have used H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers and say they are a critical tool for hard-to-fill positions. But critics have said they undercut US citizens who could take those jobs. Some on the right have called for the programme to be eliminated.

Between October 2022 and September 2023, 72 per cent of the nearly 4 lakh visas issued under the H-1B programme went to Indian nationals. During the same period, top four Indian IT majors with a presence in the US — Infosys, TCS, HCL, and Wipro — obtained approval for around 20,000 employees to work on H-1B visas, as per the latest US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data.","Elon Musk called the H-1B visa program ""broken"" and advocated for reforms, including higher minimum salaries and yearly maintenance costs for employers. He previously defended the program, saying it was crucial for tech companies like Tesla and SpaceX. His stance contrasts with some conservative factions that see it as unfair to US workers. Former President Trump supports the program, while critics argue it hurts US job opportunities. The majority of H-1B visas go to Indian nationals, particularly for positions in the IT sector.",International News,83,582
The Hans India,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Telangana Govt to dangle perks bait before docs for transfers  ,"Hyderabad: With many doctors reluctant to move out of Hyderabad, the State government is mulling to provide perks to the government doctors who would be transferred to other districts. The process of transfers started in the health department on Thursday after the department listed out the details of the employees sticking to Hyderabad over the coming transfers for decades. However, many doctors do not want to leave Hyderabad. The doctors would be losing out on the house rent allowances when they are transferred to other districts. According to sources, the government is trying to compensate for their loss by providing some perks to the doctors. The proposal was at the discussion stage, and if this is approved, the doctors may agree to work in remote areas, sources said
According to the doctors working in the peripheral areas, they have been bringing one issue or another to stay in Hyderabad. The doctors are using the option of a spouse to stay in the city, which is making the government doctors complain. Some others are arguing that they are super specialty experts and that shifting them to other places would affect the super specialty services in the city. These doctors held government positions while also engaging in private practice, which violates regulations. Despite changes in government, they remained in their roles, hindering rural doctors from accessing modern technology in hospitals.
The teaching doctors, who are agitated over not getting opportunities, were hoping that the government would come to their rescue. “I have been working in Nizamabad for almost 12 years. I should also get the opportunity to work in the super specialty wings. Why can't those working in super specialty wings provide services in rural areas?” said a teaching doctor.
Some of the doctors are using the provision of immunity under the guise of trade unions. According to an estimate, there are about 300 members who claim to be office bearers of unions and are getting exemption from the transfers. The doctors demand the government take into account the official unions rather than all other unions. The doctors expressed that, while the current government appears sincere in its transfer policies, they remain concerned about influential doctors evading transfers through conspiracies.
","Hyderabad faces challenges as government doctors resist transfers to rural areas, citing loss of perks like house rent allowances. Doctors exploit spousal options and claim super specialty expertise, hindering equitable healthcare access. Teaching doctors seek fair opportunities. Concerns arise over influential doctors evading transfers through union loopholes despite government efforts to enforce policies.",Health and Wellness,53,368

This test flight will be notable because it will be the company’s first ever attempt to catch Starship’s first-stage booster rocket on its return to the launch pad in Boca Chica, Texas. The launch tower has retractable arms that will be used to catch the rocket as it descends on the launch pad.

“Starship stacked ahead of its fifth flight test. We expect regulatory approval in time to fly on October 13,” the company said.

SpaceX is designing the Starship spacecraft and its Super Heavy booster rocket to be reusable for multi-planetary missions to the Moon and Mars.

The company previously noted that the catch attempt will only be possible if conditions are right. If SpaceX aborts the catch attempt at the launch tower, the Super Heavy booster will simulate a landing attempt in the Gulf of Mexico.

The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) told Sputnik on Tuesday that the company submitted new information in mid-August for its proposed fifth test flight. The FAA is continuing to review this information and will make a licensing determination once SpaceX has met all licensing requirements, the spokesperson added.","SpaceX is poised to receive federal regulatory approval for the launch of its fifth Starship Super Heavy rocket this weekend in Texas.

The Pioneer,2025-01-04 00:00:00,ICAI seeks tax benefits to promote climate change mitigation strategies,"Chartered accountants’ apex body ICAI has sought tax benefits for promoting climate change mitigation strategies and a separate section for income from shares and securities in the income tax returns form.

Besides, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has sought a special tax regime for partnership firms and limited liability partnerships (LLPs) as well as simplification of income tax return forms.

The institute on Friday said it has advocated for prudent tax reforms aimed at fostering economic growth and encouraging environmental sustainability in the pre-Budget Memorandum 2025.

“Provision of tax benefits for promoting climate change mitigation strategies, which will not only contribute to India’s climate change goals but also drive economic growth by promoting sustainable business practices is a suggestion in this direction,” it said in a release.

Among other suggestions, ICAI has proposed a new head to show income from shares and securities that will have provisions relating to taxability of income by way of dividend, interest or capital gains.

Rationalising conditions for treating a return of income as defective in the e-filing regime and provision of opportunity of being heard before treating a defective return as invalid is another suggestion by the institute.

ICAI has also pitched for simplifying the capital gains provisions under sections 54 to 54F of the Act, extending 10 per cent tolerance band to cases where value is determined by the valuation officer under Section 50C(2), rationalising rate of tax under Section 115BBE in respect of cash credits and unexplained investments.

Further, the institute has proposed obtaining report of a chartered accountant in the prescribed form certifying the sum chargeable to tax instead of going through the process of getting the certificate of lower deduction of tax from the assessing officer, where a non-resident transfers immovable property to a resident.

As per the release, another recommendation is to exempt the transferee responsible for paying to a non-resident transferor from the requirement of obtaining TAN.

Meanwhile, ICAI has submitted its final recommendations regarding simplifying the I-T Act, including introduction of special tax regime for partnership firms/LLPs, simplification of the registration and taxation regime of charitable trusts as well as provisions for determining residential status of individuals.

Other suggestions include simplification of income tax return forms, alignment of TDS/TCS rates with the objective of serving as an audit trail, periodic review of disposal of cases by assessing officer, mandatory time limit for disposal of appeals, and effective grievance redressal mechanism.

Another recommendation is the extension of time limit for filing belated return to March 31 of the assessment year.","The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has submitted its pre-Budget 2025 recommendations, emphasizing tax reforms to support economic growth and environmental sustainability. It proposes tax benefits for climate change mitigation strategies and suggests a separate section in income tax forms for income from shares and securities.

ICAI also advocates for simplifying tax processes, including a special tax regime for partnership firms and LLPs, rationalizing capital gains provisions, and streamlining income tax return forms. It recommends easing conditions for defective returns in the e-filing system, extending the 10% tolerance band for valuation under Section 50C(2), and aligning TDS/TCS rates to improve audit trails.

Other suggestions include exempting transferees from TAN requirements for non-resident property transfers and allowing chartered accountants to certify tax amounts instead of involving assessing officers. ICAI seeks simplified rules for charitable trusts, revised provisions for determining residential status, mandatory timelines for appeals, and effective grievance redressal mechanisms.

The institute also suggests extending the deadline for belated tax returns to March 31 of the assessment year, aiming for a more efficient and taxpayer-friendly system. These reforms are intended to foster compliance, enhance economic productivity, and encourage sustainable practices.",Business and Finance,191,425

The Arunachal Times ,2024-07-20 00:00:00,Ageing dreams: The saga of lingering APPSC exam,"few days ago, one student called me and said, “When will APPSC exams be held? Sir, in 2020, when I started my preparations, I was only 22 years old. Today I am 27 years old. Did I do wrong by committing to my dream of clearing the exam?” he said in a quavering voice. I felt sad to hear that, but I consoled him somehow.

The question, however, is pertinent as many aspirants are sailing the ocean of preparations like a rudderless ship.

Four years have elapsed since the last APPSC exams were held in 2020. After the results were announced in 2020, I could see so many youths motivated and excited to prepare for the exam. However, as the APPSC fiasco shook the entire state, the examination process lingered for an eternity. In these four years, while navigating the endless wait, many dreams have been crushed and buried; one who was young and energetic in 2020 is now four years older, and some have become overage.

However, this is not a new trend. The pace of the examination is something to be seriously looked into.

As a mentor to some aspirants, I keep telling them, “Do your duty – study. That is the only thing that you can do.” But, while saying so, we also need to understand the plight of the aspirants. For how long can the aspirants sit inside the four walls, burning the midnight oil, when everything seems dark and opaque for them? It is observed that some aspirants who were very promising and enthusiastic in 2020 have now vanished from the scene, I believe to find some other means of livelihood for themselves and their families.

Everyone is not lucky enough to have the resources to survive for four-five years of preparations without doing anything.

Then, as a relief measure, the government has raised the age bar to 38 years, but that is good for mostly in-service candidates. If there are some of the in-service candidates who have turned overage in these four years, whom will they blame? For others, it usually matters as only a few will be taking the exams until the age of 38. We should not be expected to wait until someone reaches 38. The clock ticks and time doesn’t wait; with every second passing, the aspirants are getting older and anxious. This doesn’t augur well for the state, as it is getting devoid of its young potential workforce.

Then many sprinkle salt on the wounds of the aspirants and preach, “Why wait for one exam? Do some business or work somewhere else; take other exams.” But it needs to be understood that it was never the fault of the aspirants that they wanted to take the APPSC exam, or that they wished to be part of the steel frame of the state. So, any blame on the youths for choosing the APPSC exam does not stand aground. We should accept that the youths have not failed themselves; instead, the system has failed them.

I understand that SOPs are being prepared and other measures are being taken by the government. But for now, a certain deadline should be fixed for the completion of the SOPs and the implementation of the different measures – say, five months, or even a year, if needed – but there needs to be a timeline; this will ease the pain of the aspirants.

Then, a tentative exam calendar should be prepared with expected dates, along with the number of vacancies accumulated in these four years. Then, regarding the APPSC fiasco, the parties, if they feel that their concerns have not been addressed should knock on the door of the courts instead of blocking the entire process.

The fiasco has indeed shaken the spirit and broken the trust of the people to its core, but we cannot let the tug of war from becoming a roadblock; the process must be allowed to start, because there is no solution to scepticism.

The toll of the delays on the aspirants is huge; aspirants are stranded in the middle, with nowhere to go after putting in so much time and energy in their years of preparations. Now, we should ponder how to help the youths caught up in this APPSC limbo. The deferred hopes of our youths should not be allowed to turn into despair. Now it is time to end this ‘delay crisis’. (The contributor is DIPRO, Lohit.)","A student expressed frustration over the long delay in the APPSC exams, having waited four years since the last test in 2020. Many aspirants, initially enthusiastic, are now older and struggling due to the extended wait. While the government has raised the age limit to 38, this benefits mainly in-service candidates. Critics argue that the system’s delays have hurt young aspirants, who have invested years in preparation. The author suggests setting deadlines for SOP completion, creating a tentative exam calendar, and addressing concerns through legal means rather than disrupting the process. Urgent action is needed to prevent further despair among hopeful candidates.",Opinion and Editorial,102,739

The sentinel ,2024-11-03 00:00:00,Digital Life Certificate Campaign to Benefit over 1.81 Lakh Pensioners,"More than 1.8 lakh pensioners generated their digital life certificates (DLC) on the very first day, even as the government rolled out the largest-ever campaign.

New Delhi: More than 1.8 lakh pensioners generated their digital life certificates (DLC) on the very first day, even as the government rolled out the largest-ever campaign, the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions said.

The Department of Pension & Pensioners' Welfare on Friday launched the third and the largest nationwide DLC campaign in 800 cities or districts across India from November 1-30.

""This is the biggest-ever DLC campaign undertaken,"" said a statement issued by the personnel ministry.

The total number of DLCs generated by Friday evening was 1.81 lakh, it added.

The Campaign is being held in collaboration with CGDA, DoT, Railways, UIDAI, and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITy) to reach all the pensioners in the remotest corners of the country.

In addition ""19 banks, 785 district post offices, and 57 welfare associations,"" will also collaborate in the month-long campaign.

The campaign aims ""to promote digital empowerment of pensioners using face authentication technology"", the ministry said, adding that during the campaign technical support will be provided by MEITy and UIDAI.

""Face authentication has been made more seamless and convenient for the elderly pensioners, and can be used on Android as well as iOS,"" the ministry said.

The technology enables the identification of a pensioner by a facial scan using a smartphone camera from the convenience of their homes to complete the process of submitting the DLC without having to travel to banks or post offices for the purpose.

The authentication is carried out against UIDAI's Aadhaar database using UIDAI's Face Recognition Application.

In June, the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) noted a more than threefold jump in the number of EPS pensioners submitting Facial Authentication Technology-based Digital Life Certificates -- from 2.1 lakh in 2022-23 to 6.6 lakh in 2023-24.

EPFO said that the 6.6 lakh facial scan-based DLCs in 2023-24 comprise almost 10 per cent of the total DLCs received during the year. Taken together around 60 lakh DLCs were received from the pensioners during the last financial year. (IANS)","On the first day of the largest nationwide Digital Life Certificate (DLC) campaign, over 1.8 lakh pensioners generated their certificates. Launched by the Ministry of Personnel, the month-long initiative, running from November 1-30, aims to digitally empower pensioners using face authentication technology. Collaborating with various government bodies, the campaign facilitates easy DLC generation from home via smartphone facial scans.

The Economic Times,2024-12-16 00:00:00,"India's fiscal deficit will be 4.8 pc in FY25, below budget estimate of 4.9 pc: CareEdge Ratings ","New Delhi: The fiscal deficit of the central government is projected to be 4.8 per cent of GDP for FY25, slightly below the budgeted estimate of 4.9 per cent, according to a report by CareEdge Ratings. The marginal improvement is attributed to healthy tax collections, despite certain shortfalls.
However, the Centre's capital expenditure (capex) is expected to fall short of its target by Rs 1.5 trillion, which could impact long-term infrastructure growth. At the same time, revenue expenditure might exceed budget estimates due to additional allocations under the first supplementary grant.

It said ""Gross tax revenue supported by healthy performance in GST and income tax collection. This has helped partially offset the weakness in corporate tax and union excise duty collections"".

The report noted that the nominal GDP growth is estimated to be lower at 9.9 per cent, compared to the budgeted 10.5 per cent for FY25. Despite this moderation, India's real GDP growth is expected to remain healthy at 6.5 per cent in FY25. The report also predicts moderation in consumer price index (CPI) inflation, as food prices stabilize.

The central government is anticipated to maintain its fiscal consolidation efforts, keeping the fiscal deficit trajectory on track.

On the external front, India's export performance is expected to be mixed. Merchandise exports are projected to grow modestly by 2.5 per cent in FY25, as global uncertainties weigh on demand.

However, services exports are forecast to grow robustly by 13 per cent, supported by sectors like IT and professional services. Additionally, remittances are likely to remain strong, further aiding the current account balance.

India's current account deficit (CAD) is projected to remain manageable at 0.9 per cent of GDP for FY25, reflecting resilience in the external sector.

Overall, the report paints a balanced picture of the economy, with positive tax revenue trends and services exports offsetting some challenges in capex and merchandise trade.
","A report by CareEdge Ratings projects India's fiscal deficit for FY25 at 4.8% of GDP, slightly below the budgeted 4.9%, due to healthy tax collections in GST and income tax, despite weaker corporate tax and excise duty revenues.

The Indian Express,2024-10-12 00:00:00,We didn’t want to do anything different between ODI and T20I WCs: Rahul Dravid,"Former India head coach Rahul Dravid on Wednesday said the support staff strived to carry the energetic “team atmosphere” from the ODI World Cup in 2023 to the T20 showpiece, and the approach helped the team to end a barren run in ICC tournaments.
Dravid masterminded India’s triumph in the T20 World Cup in the Americas before signing off from his role as the head coach.
“Honestly, I didn’t want to do anything different. I think we ran a fantastic campaign in the one-day World Cup, Rohit and the team, everyone involved in that one-day World Cup, we ran a superb campaign,” Dravid said at the Ceat Cricket Rating Awards here.
India had suffered a heartbreaking defeat against Australia in the ODI World Cup final at Ahmedabad.
“There’s nothing we could have done more in terms of our preparation, the planning, the execution of what we needed to do for 10 games in a row to dominate, to win the game we did, play the game we did,” said Dravid.
The Bengaluru man said he and the rest of the coaching staff did not want to break the set pattern of a cordial dressing room.
“I did not want to change anything. If you’d asked me and we had a discussion with our support staff, we’d get together with the coaches and say, what do you think we should do differently?” “The common consensus (among the team) was we need to do exactly what we did. We need to create the same energy, create the same vibe, the same team atmosphere that we had and then just hope that on the day, we’ll have a little bit of luck,” he said.
Though he did not experience playing in a World Cup in either of the limited-over formats in India, he was able to soak in all the elation as the head coach.
“To travel all over this country and to be able to experience that joy and passion of the fans. I’ve never been a part of a World Cup as a player in India, but just the experience as a coach to go from city to city and just walk and see what this game meant to the people of this country was phenomenal. It was incredible,” he said.
Dravid said Australia were the better team during the ODI World Cup final.

“I thought we ran a phenomenal campaign. We came unstuck in the final and Australia played better cricket than us on the day. They were a better team and congratulations (to them). That can happen in sport and that’s what sport is about,” he said.
","Former India head coach Rahul Dravid emphasized the importance of maintaining the positive team atmosphere from the ODI World Cup as India transitioned to the T20 format, leading to their success in the T20 World Cup. Dravid reflected on India's impressive performance during the ODI World Cup, acknowledging the heartbreak of losing to Australia in the final. He expressed pride in experiencing the excitement of fans across India and recognized that Australia played better on the day of the final. Dravid reiterated the team's commitment to replicating their successful approach moving forward.",Sports,92,438

The Morung Express,2024-12-18 00:00:00,Cyberattacks using GenAI tech expected to increase next year,"Cyberattacks utilising generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology as a tool are expected to grow next year, a government report showed on Wednesday.
In 2025, hacking groups are expected to increasingly use various generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, to create spear phishing emails customized to their attack subjects and fake news materials to be used for political propaganda, according to the annual cybersecurity report issued by the Ministry of Science and ICT.
""It will be difficult to tell the authenticity of sophisticated content created with the help of AI,"" the report said, noting such content could rapidly spread across the internet and influence people's judgment.
""The manipulation of public opinion by certain groups could lead to social conflict and confusion.""
The report also warned of a possible increase in blackmail cases using deepfake materials as witnessed in the country earlier this year, reports Yonhap news agency.
South Korea saw a series of deepfake sex crime cases in early 2024, with police having apprehended 506 suspects in such cases as of October.
Additionally, the report said activities of state-sponsored hacking groups may increase next year due to global political uncertainties following the re-election of Donald Trump as U.S. president.
""The United States is expected to make policy shifts toward easing regulations on technology and virtual asset industries and promoting protectionism,"" the report said, warning those changes could lead to an increase in attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and companies developing strategic technologies, such as AI and quantum.

the morung express,2024-07-07 00:00:00,NH-29 rockslide: Nagaland PWD points fingers at NHIDCL amid safety concerns,"Kohima, July 7 (MExN):  Two days after another rockslide incident on National Highway-29, the Nagaland Public Works Department (National Highway) emphasised that ensuring the safety of commuters and addressing the concerns of the public are top priorities for the State government, which has consistently urged NHIDCL to mitigate risks along the Dimapur-Kohima 4-lane road.

The Department has also urged the National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL) to expeditiously implement safety measures, especially on the stretches under Package-I considering the terrain, it stated.

The NHIDCL is the agency responsible for maintaining quality parameters and safety standards of the Dimapur-Kohima 4-lane highway, it added. 

In a press release, NPWD (NH) informed that following the July 4, 2023 incident at ‘Pagla Pahar,’ the State Government had constituted a High-Level Technical Committee (HLTC) the next day. The HLTC’s report and recommendations were conveyed to NHIDCL on July 19 for ‘immediate action,’ it maintained. Among other directives, NHIDCL was instructed to carry out short-term measures as per the HLTC's recommendations and to undertake a comprehensive study of the terrain to mitigate future risks, it highlighted.

The Department further stated that in December 2023, the State Government had also pointed out the report and findings of the IIT (Bombay) Independent Technical Expert Committee, raising serious concerns regarding the construction and hill cutting methods on the highway. 

The report highlighted significant deviations from IRC (Indian Roads Congress) guidelines, inadequate slope protection, poor rockfall mitigation, and non-compliance with safety and quality standards, among other issues, it added.

As a follow-up, the agency was instructed to examine the works to be undertaken to ensure NH-29 becomes a safe, smooth, and all-weather highway, it said.

Taking cognisance of the growing safety concerns along the ‘Pagla Pahar’ stretch, the State Cabinet, in its meeting held on January 22, 2024, discussed the necessary measures to be taken and decided to engage an independent third party to undertake a detailed study and recommend measures to ensure the highway's safety for commuters, it said. Accordingly, IIT Guwahati has been engaged to conduct this exercise, which will commence its studies soon, it added.

The State Cabinet also questioned NHIDCL on how and why a completion certificate for Dimapur-Kohima Package-II had been issued when several portions are yet to be completed and quality issues remain to be addressed.

According to NPWD (NH), both concerns were brought to the notice of the office of the Managing Director, NHIDCL Headquarters, on January 31, 2024.

Furthermore, in April 2024, the State Government instructed NHIDCL to submit specific safety measures implemented along the stretch of NH-29 and warned that the agency would be solely responsible for any incidents or accidents due to inadequate safety measures, it added.

The Department highlighted that in the interest of public and road safety on the Dimapur-Kohima 4-lane of NH-29, with special regard to the ‘Pagla Pahar’ stretch, the State Government has officially raised the issue with NHIDCL on as many as eighteen occasions from April 11, 2023, to June 19, 2024. However, no significant tangible initiative has been observed on the ground, it asserted.

To this end, it noted that while the State Government is making all possible efforts to ensure road travel is safe for commuters, it was distressing to witness another incident at the Pagla Pahar stretch of NH-29 on July 5, 2024, resulting in injury to four individuals and vehicle damage. 

The State Government is committed to addressing the matter with the concerned authorities in a serious manner and urges NHIDCL to respond proactively and sincerely to ensure commuter safety, it added.","In Kohima, the Nagaland Public Works Department (National Highway) emphasized the state government's priority to ensure commuter safety on the Dimapur-Kohima 4-lane highway, particularly addressing concerns at the 'Pagla Pahar' stretch. Despite multiple directives and warnings to NHIDCL (National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited), responsible for maintaining the highway, issues persist regarding safety standards and quality compliance. The state government has taken serious measures, including forming technical committees and engaging IIT Guwahati for a safety study, following recent incidents like the July 5, 2024 rockslide injuring four individuals. The government's efforts aim to prompt NHIDCL into proactive action to mitigate risks and ensure the highway becomes safe and reliable for all commuters.",Environment,113,593

They make TV shows their life, and they forget that this is not real life. We are playing our parts.

 The Shillong Times,2025-01-04 00:00:00,"HMPV a ‘winter occurrence,’ ‘less severe, spreading on a smaller scale’: China","New Delhi, Jan 4: The Covid-like Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), currently spreading in China is just a ‘winter occurrence,’ is less severe, and is spreading on a smaller scale, said the country’s foreign ministry spokesperson.

The statement comes as photos and videos emerged on social media showing hospitals in China swamped with people amid rising cases of HMPV – causing respiratory illness –, and raising serious concerns of another pandemic akin to Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning called it an annual occurrence in winter and assured that the country is safe to travel.

“Respiratory infections tend to peak during the winter season in the Northern Hemisphere. Recently, the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration of China held a press conference to share information about the prevention and control of respiratory diseases in China during the wintertime,” said Ning.

“The diseases appear to be less severe and spread on a smaller scale compared with the previous year,” she added. Further, reassuring the safety of citizens and tourists, she noted: “I can assure you that the Chinese government cares about the health of Chinese citizens and foreigners coming to China”, adding that “It is safe to travel in China”.

Over the last few days, there has been a sudden spike in respiratory illnesses across China, reminding people of a similar surge before Covid was confirmed. The media in neighbouring countries like Indonesia, India, and Japan also cautioned its citizens to be aware of the situation in China and take needed precautions.

Meanwhile, Indian health officials have also assured that there is no need to worry. “The spread of HMPV in China is like any other respiratory virus,” said Dr Atul Goel, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), while speaking to the media “There is no need for alarm, about the present situation,” he added. T

he expert noted that the disease can lead to “flu-like symptoms,” in the elderly and very young children. HMPV was first discovered in 2001 and is part of the Pneumoviridae family along with the Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The virus can lead to upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages. Young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are majorly affected.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. It reportedly has an incubation period of between three to five days. Wearing a mask, washing hands frequently, and increasing immunity can help prevent the disease. HMPV had in 2023 been detected in the Netherlands, Britain, Finland, Australia, Canada, the US, and China.","The Chinese foreign ministry has downplayed concerns about the spread of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) in the country, calling it a seasonal, less severe occurrence.

He alleged this is rooted in the political patronage which these extremists enjoy and are `fostered’ by political parties with vested interests. However, he also added any foreign interference in Canadian affairs is 'unacceptable.

He further shared that he was forced to participate in a Hindu event in Edmonton under the protection of police officers due to disruptive demonstrations by Khalistani protesters.

Sharing a video on X, Arya wrote, ""I have heard concerns from Hindus across Canada regarding recent developments. As a Hindu Member of Parliament, I too have experienced these concerns firsthand. Last week, I could safely participate in a Hindu event in Edmonton only under the protection of RCMP officers, as a group of Khalistani protesters staged a disruptive demonstration against me. In Canada, we have long recognized the serious problem of Khalistani violent extremism.""


Arya belongs to Trudeau's Liberal Party and these remarks by him come a day after the Canadian Prime Minister accused India of violating his country sovereignty.

""Let me be clear, any actions or involvement by foreign state actors within Canada, in any form, are unacceptable. As Canadians, we do not wish for Canada to interfere in the domestic affairs of other nations. Likewise, we do not want foreign governments interfering in Canada’s domestic matters, including those involving Khalistani extremism.

RCMP Commissioner Michael Duheme stated at the same press conference: ""There’s a violent, extremist threat in Canada that both countries have been working on over the years. However, recent revelations and developments are impacting Canada and India's ability to collaborate on this issue. It is critical that we all recognize the importance of eliminating cross-border threats posed by Khalistani extremism and resume our efforts to address it effectively. The persistence of Canadian Khalistani extremism is rooted in the political patronage these extremists enjoy, ‘’ he wrote.

Arya further wrote, ""Unfortunately, I have yet to hear any politician or government official offer reassurance to Hindu-Canadians, many of whom feel concerned and fearful for their safety in light of recent events. To my fellow Hindu Canadians: We are one of the most educated and successful communities in this country, contributing greatly to Canada’s progress. Yet, our low profile is often mistaken for weakness by politicians. I pledge to do my best to advocate on your behalf. However, my efforts alone are not enough. The only way to have our concerns addressed is for Hindu Canadians to raise their voices and hold all politicians accountable. Together, we must ensure that our safety and interests are protected"".

Arya has been a vocal critic of Khalistani extremism in Canada in the past had condemned the attacks on Hindu temples in Canada which were allegedly carried out by pro-Khalistan sympathizers.

""For the poor in conflict-affected countries, the struggle for basic needs is a far harsher and more desperate battle,"" Zhang told AFP.

The report echoed last year's findings that 1.1 billion out of 6.1 billion people across 110 countries were facing extreme multidimensional poverty.

Thursday's paper showed that some 584 million people under 18 were experiencing extreme poverty, accounting for 27.9 percent of children worldwide, compared with 13.5 percent of adults.

It also showed that 83.2 percent of the world's poorest people live in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

Sabina Alkire, director of the OPHI, told AFP that conflicts were hindering efforts for poverty reduction.

""At some level, these findings are intuitive. But what shocked us was the sheer magnitude of people who are struggling to live a decent life and at the same time fearing for their safety –- 455 million,"" she said.

""This points to a stark but unavoidable challenge to the international community to both zero in on poverty reduction and foster peace, so that any ensuing peace actually endures,"" Alkire added.

India was the country with the largest number of people in extreme poverty, which impacts 234 million of its 1.4 billion population.

It was followed by Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The five countries accounted for nearly half of the 1.1 billion poor people.

","A UN Development Program (UNDP) report, in collaboration with the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI), revealed that over 1.1 billion people globally are living in acute multidimensional poverty, with children comprising more than half of those affected. Poverty is especially severe in conflict zones, where rates are three times higher, and 455 million people in war-torn regions face extreme deprivation. Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia host the majority of the world's poorest. India tops the list with 234 million people in extreme poverty, followed by Pakistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

What Farhan said
Talking about the effect, Farhan said: “It obviously could not have been easy. Because eventually at the end of the day a relationship that they think in their mind is solid and perfect is being fractured. So there will be some degree of anger… even now I would imagine, within them. Some sadness, some resentment. That is something that with time and conversation there will be some kind of solace and understanding. For me, I did feel tremendously guilty… towards them when Adhuna and I are divorced because it had nothing to do with them. So they are the kind of like collateral damage in some emotional way.”

Meanwhile, Shibani talked about Farhan's family and said, “They are super evolved, very liberal. From his father, mother, stepmother, sister, his children… everybody. There is a certain way of thinking and approaching a situation… where they never made me feel that I am on the outside. I give so much credit to his daughters who have been raised by their parents to be super-thinkers, their awareness of the world and the environment, and the construct of the family is so understood and accepted.” After dating for almost three years, Farhan and Shibani tied the knot at Farhan's family farmhouse in Khandala in the presence of close friends and family members on February 19, 2022. Farhan was previously married to celebrity hairstylist Adhuna Bhabani. The two got married in 2000 and parted ways in 2017. They are parents to two daughters, Shakya and Akira.

Islamic State fighters have killed nearly 4,100 people in Syria since 2019 when the jihadists lost their last stronghold in the country, a war monitor said on June 29.

IS overran large swathes of Syria and Iraq in 2014, proclaiming a so-called caliphate and launching a reign of terror in June of that year.

In March 2019, the jihadist group lost its last scraps of Syrian territory in a Kurdish-led military campaign backed by a US-led coalition, but remnants continue to launch deadly attacks from desert hideouts.

 Decade after IS horrors, Iraq's Sinjar remains in ruins

IS fighters ""have killed about 4,100 people in more than 2,550 operations in areas controlled by the regime or"" the semi-autonomous Kurdish administration since 2019, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in a report.

Most of the victims are soldiers, government loyalists and Kurdish-led fighters, but the toll also incudes 627 civilians, the Britain-based Observatory said.

More than half of the 4,085 victims fell in Syria's vast Badia desert, which runs from the outskirts of Damascus to the Iraqi border.

 Watch | What is the Islamic State-Khorasan and why did they attack Russia?

A total of ""2,744 people have been killed by the IS group since its formal collapse in 2019, in various areas of the Syrian desert,"" said the monitor, which relies on a network of sources inside the country.

IS fighters have killed more than 2,500 government loyalists and soldiers in the Badia since their so-called caliphate fell, according to the Observatory.

""Hardly a day goes by without bombings, ambushes, targeted operations or surprise attacks"" by the jihadists in the region, the report said.

 Attack blamed on IS militants kills 22 pro-government fighters in central Syria

""These operations are met with periodic security campaigns carried out by regime forces and groups loyal to them deep in the desert, with... Russian warplanes targeting the desert on a near-daily basis,"" it added.

The group has sustained heavy damage, losing more than 2,000 fighters including top leaders since 2019, the report found.

A United Nations report released in January said IS's combined strength in Iraq and Syria was between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters, with the Badia serving as a logistics and operations hub for the group in Syria.

Syria's war has killed more than half a million people and displaced millions more since it broke out in March 2011 with Damascus's brutal repression of anti-government protests.

Addressing a virtual press conference, Singh said that Scindia was like his son. He said, â€œWhen he (Scindia) was with the Congress, he had a say in appointing district presidents from Morena to Mandsaur. No other leader got the same respect in the Congress as you did. It wonâ€™t happen now because the RSS calls the shots in the BJP and you have criticised it in the past.â€ â€œMaybe you were in a hurry to get into Narendra Modiâ€™s ministry,â€ Singh said, adding that the voters will â€œteach a lessonâ€ to those who brought down the Kamal Nath-led Congress government a lesson in the ensuing by-elections to 24 seats. When asked whether the Congress would shift its MLAs in the state to resorts ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections, Singh said, â€œThose who could be bought over have already gone,â€ referring to the partyâ€™s leaders and legislators, led by Scindia, who switched over to the BJP, bringing down the Nath government in March. â€œThere are many legislators for whom even Rs 1 crore means a lot, but they did not succumb even when offered huge sums,â€ he said, taking a dig at the MLAs who defected to BJP, allegedly after being offered sums in excess of Rs 30 crore. Singh also claimed he had conveyed to Scindia that while both he and Nath are in their 70s and would soon fade away, the former Guna MP had two-three decades of active politics before him. Recalling that former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had brought the anti-defection law, Singh said the law should now be amended again to ban peopleâ€™s representatives who change parties from contesting for six years. Singh also accused Tulsiram Silawat and Govind Singh Rajput â€” two Scindia supporters who are now in Shivraj Singh Chouhanâ€™s cabinet â€” of corruption.

A top adviser of Bangladesh’s interim government on Monday said that deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s stay in India will not hurt bilateral relations and Dhaka will always try to maintain good relations with New Delhi.

Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain made the comments when he was asked whether bilateral ties with India will be affected if Hasina’s stay in India gets prolonged, Bangladesh media reported.

“This is a hypothetical question. If someone stays in a country why the relations with that particular country will be affected? There is no reason for that,” he said, emphasising that bilateral relations were a big matter.

Hossain said bilateral relations were a relation of interest and friendship is also of interest. “Friendship does not exist if the interest is hurt.” He said the two sides - Bangladesh and India - have interests and they will follow those interests.

The Arunachal Times,2024-12-31 00:00:00,Medicant Hospital Bokaro sets new benchmarks in healthcare,"Medicant Hospital Bokaro has emerged as a trailblazer in medical science, establishing new milestones in healthcare for Jharkhand. Under the expertise of Dr. Rahul Raj, Consultant in Radiology and Interventional Radiology, the hospital has achieved two groundbreaking medical procedures, marking firsts for Bokaro and among the select few in the state.

In one notable case, a 50-year-old woman suffering from kidney stones for six months found relief at Medicant after several failed treatments elsewhere. A CT 128 slice scan revealed a renal abscess, prompting Dr. Rahul Raj to perform a guided pigtail insertion. This minimally invasive procedure successfully drained the abscess, leading to a remarkable recovery. The patient was discharged within 24 hours, showcasing the hospital’s efficiency and advanced care.

In another achievement, Medicant Hospital performed a CT coronary angiography on a patient experiencing angina. This non-invasive diagnostic procedure eliminates the need for catheterization and prolonged observation. The patient was able to return home just ten minutes after the investigation, making it a significant step forward in patient-centric cardiac care.

Medicant Hospital in Bokaro has positioned itself at the forefront of medical innovation in Jharkhand, thanks to its recent breakthroughs in radiology and interventional radiology under the guidance of Dr. Rahul Raj, Consultant in Radiology and Interventional Radiology. These achievements not only mark firsts for Bokaro but also place the hospital among the few in the state capable of performing such advanced procedures.

One of the hospital’s landmark achievements involved a 50-year-old female patient who had been suffering from persistent kidney stone complications for over six months. Despite multiple treatments at other institutions, her condition remained unresolved. At Medicant Hospital, a CT 128-slice scan conducted under Dr. Rahul Raj’s supervision revealed a renal abscess. Instead of opting for invasive surgery, Dr. Raj performed a guided pigtail insertion—a minimally invasive technique to drain the abscess. The procedure was a success, resulting in the patient’s swift recovery and discharge within just 24 hours. This not only alleviated her long-standing condition but also highlighted the hospital’s commitment to efficient and advanced patient care.

In another significant development, Medicant Hospital successfully conducted a CT coronary angiography for a patient presenting with symptoms of angina. This modern diagnostic method, which utilizes advanced imaging technology, avoids the need for traditional catheterization and hospital admission. The procedure was completed in minutes, and the patient was discharged just ten minutes later. The use of CT coronary angiography at Medicant represents a shift toward less invasive, faster, and safer cardiac diagnostics—particularly beneficial for patients with time-sensitive health concerns.

Both cases underscore Medicant Hospital’s expanding capabilities in delivering high-end diagnostic and interventional services. With these pioneering efforts, Dr. Rahul Raj and the Medicant team are setting new benchmarks in Jharkhand's healthcare landscape, promising safer, faster, and more effective medical care for patients across the region.

The Navhind Times,2024-12-30 00:00:00,2024 set to end as hottest year on record,"Year 2024 is set to end as the hottest year on record and the first with a global average temperature 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. It will also be remembered as the year developed nations had their last big chance to prevent the world from permanently crossing this critical threshold by funding climate action in the Global South - and they blew it. Relentless warming fuelled record-breaking heatwaves, deadly storms and floods that devastated lives and homes by the thousands in 2024. Millions were displaced, and all eyes turned to the UN climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, hoping for a climate finance package capable of ramping up action in the Global South. A study published in 2023 estimated that developed countries owe around $170 trillion for their excessive emissions, having consumed 70-90% of the total carbon budget since the industrial era. Instead, developed countries - mandated under the UN climate regime to finance climate action in developing countries - offered a paltry $300 billion by 2035, a mere fraction of the trillions needed annually from 2025. India called the new climate finance package ""too little, too distant"", and ""an optical illusion"". Developing countries faced a difficult choice: return to negotiations next year or accept the weak deal on the table. Fearing an even worse outcome in 2025 with the return of ""climate denier"" Donald Trump and a US exit from the Paris Agreement, the Global South reluctantly accepted the offer.

Hindustan Times,2024-07-01 00:00:00,"India erupts in celebration, salutes its World Cup legends","New Delhi : As the final ball of the ICC T20 World Cup final was bowled, Rohit Sharma, fielding at cover, held his arms up in triumph and then collapsed, face first, to the ground. He slapped the ground in joy before letting the tears flow. Rahul Dravid, in the dressing room, got out of his chair, let out a joyful scream and punched the air in delight. The tears flowed a little later.

Elsewhere, Virat Kohli, for once spared us the histrionics. He put his arms up, closed his eyes and looked to the heavens at the Kensington Oval.

Back in India, meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people spilled onto the streets early on Sunday morning in raucous celebration, their faces painted in the tricolours, wearing the signature India blue. From Jammu to Chennai, from Hyderabad to Kolkata, nearly every town and city in the country stayed up late, a collective sigh of relief that echoed the euphoria thousands of kilometres away in Barbados.

The trophy was won, and even before the raw emotion of the moment could leave the system, Kohli – the player of the final – announced he was done with T20Is. A little later, in the post-match press conference, Rohit did the same. Dravid had already announced his stint with the team end after the World Cup. It was, for all three, the perfect exit.

As Ian Bishop said on X, “Not many sportsmen get to write their own exit script, or time their departure from a game, or format with precision. Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Rahul Dravid have done it to perfection here.”

What was truly special about the trio was the bond they shared, the trust they had in each other. Dravid had become the coach just after Kohli’s messy departure as skipper in 2021. Rohit took over, smoothed out the rough waters and simply looked to keep taking the team forward in the most professional manner. It could have so easily escalated into an ego battle but neither Dravid nor Rohit wanted any of that.

Over the last three years, we have seen that Kohli played along as well. He bought into their ideas, shared his own views and stayed the consummate team man. The World Cup triumph has been two years in the making; two years that saw Rohit and Kohli play very little of the format. But Dravid trusted their experience and skill and they didn’t disappoint.

This wasn’t ever a teacher-student relationship. Rahul bhai, they call him. A big brother who would put a hand around their shoulder and tell them what needed to be told. It would be the captain’s call but Rahul would say his piece. It was Rohit’s reaction to these inputs that made the bond stronger.

“I will miss him as a person, forget the cricket and forget the captain and everything,” said Dravid after the win. “I hope we’ll still be friends (laughs). What has really impressed me in all of this is just what kind of person he is, the kind of respect he has shown me, the kind of care and commitment he has had for the team, the energy he has had to spend and he has never backed down from it. So, for me it is the person I will remember the most. His cricketing – he will be a great captain and a player, score runs and win trophies but it is as a person that I’ll miss him the most.”

The feeling was mutual. In the post-match presser, Rohit returned the compliment.

“He - more than any one of us, I think he deserved that trophy,” said Rohit when asked about Dravid. “What he has done for Indian cricket for the past 20-25 years, I think this was the only thing that was left in his cabinet. I am very happy from all of us on behalf of the entire team that we could actually do this for him. You saw how proud he was and how excited he was.”

It didn’t end there. Rohit had something to say about Kohli as well.

“Look, he’s been a champion player without a doubt,” said Rohit. “And we all know what he has done for us. At some point everyone has to say goodbye to the game and Virat was very clear that this is what he wanted to do; he was very clear before the start of the tournament as well. I am very happy for him that he batted like he did in the final. I know the quality that he has, the big games and all of that. He is going to come good. When we wanted him the most, he came out and performed the way he did.”

With all three stalwarts pulling in the same direction, there was never even a murmur of discontent from the dressing room. And that is what made the team stronger still. India has the financial muscle and great reserve strength. And while that helps, it also piles on the pressure.

That is where the advantage of a united team showed. It was in the simple things – sharing a meal or a joke or simply not taking things too seriously. Having Dravid in the dressing room meant having context. For many, matches are about revenge; about redemption. But the India coach knew better than most that it is just a game.

“Firstly, there is no redemption,” said Dravid. “I am not one of those guys who thinks about redemption and those kinds of things. There are a lot of other players I know who have not been able to win a trophy… I was lucky to be given the opportunity to coach, and I was lucky that this bunch of boys made it possible for me to be able to win a trophy and celebrate.”

No dream is ever chased alone. That is something Dravid believed in and he will probably find a lot of takers for that line of thought in the India dressing room, especially now. His stint might be done but that is a lesson worth remembering; for that is what trophies are made of.","As the final ball of the ICC T20 World Cup was bowled, emotions ran high as Rohit Sharma collapsed in triumph, Rahul Dravid punched the air with joy, and Virat Kohli looked to the heavens. Across India, celebrations erupted as people poured into the streets in ecstatic celebration of the World Cup win. The victory marked a fitting end for Kohli, Sharma, and Dravid, who announced their departure from T20Is. Their bond, trust, and mutual respect made the team stronger, with Dravid’s leadership and Kohli’s performance crucial to the triumph. Dravid, reflecting on the victory, emphasized the importance of camaraderie and the collective effort behind the win.",Sports,107,1030
The New Indian Express,2024-10-12 00:00:00,Punjabi students protest in Canada demanding extension of PGWPs; fear deportation,"CHANDIGARH: ""We deserve a fair chance... Stop targeting international students and immigrations... Do not change the rule in the end of the game’’ read the plank cards held by Punjabi students in Canada.

They fear deportation and are protesting against the federal government's decision to impose a cap on immigration workers and demanding to extend their Post-Graduate Work Permits (PGWPs) and fair pathways.

They are protesting in Brampton and will be holding a rally there on October 13. Immigration consultants are of the view that most students from Punjab have no technical skills. The changes in the immigration system in the past months have left immigrants, particularly international students, in distress.

Many Punjabi singers including Rupinder Handa and Guru Randhawa recently visited the protest site and announced their support to the protesters.

These students have been holding a permanent protest at Queen Street in Brampton since August. Talking with this newspaper, over the phone from Canada, Bikram Kullewali an active member of Naujawan Support Network says, ""The protests have been going on for the last couple of months, and are spearheaded by the PGWPs committee and NSN. We are just handful of students who are protesting for everybody as we want fair PR pathways and post-graduate work permits (PGWPs), due to COVID-19 there is a big backlog in all immigration schemes besides the majority of the candidates are unable to meet the Canadian Experience Class. The work permits of many have expired and many others will expire by December 31 this year. Many have applied for refugee status, while many others have moved to US and many have applied for a work permit extension.’’

""On October 13 rally, we will make announcements and protests in front of offices of Members of Parliament will be held,’’ he added.

Student leaders claimed that the move to not give extensions to those with PGWPs was likely to affect around 1.3 lakh international students. The new policy of the Canadian Government which limits the number of international students eligible for post-graduation work permits (PGWPs) has sparked outrage, particularly among the Punjabi student community as these students apprehend a bleak future, as most of them who intended to apply for permanent residency after completing their studies now are in a catch-22 situation.

A leading immigration consultant Shamsher Singh Sandhu says,``Most of the students who have gone to Canada in the recent past cannot get a post-graduate work permits (PGWPs) as Canadian authorities have put a new condition that if one want a PGWP then, one has to clear the ILETs and PGWP cannot be extended for the second time. The students who have gone to Canada after completing their Class XII and earning diploma there can beat the Canadian Experience Class (CRS) Score as the students who have done their PhD or master’s have more chances to clear the draw of lots.’’

""As most of the students from Punjab have no technical skills adding to their disadvantage, we do not think that the Canadian authorities will come under pressure of these protesters,’’ says Sandhu.

A decade ago when the study visa program picked up pace in Canada there were only 214,000 international students and now in 2022 there are over 800,000 international students.

With Canadian federal elections due next year the immigration policy is now key factor in the country.","Punjabi students in Canada are protesting against the federal government's recent immigration policies, fearing deportation and demanding extensions for Post-Graduate Work Permits (PGWPs) and fair pathways to permanent residency. They have been holding protests in Brampton since August and plan a major rally on October 13. The new policy limits international students eligible for PGWPs, particularly impacting the Punjabi community, as many students face expired or soon-to-expire work permits.

Support from Punjabi singers like Rupinder Handa and Guru Randhawa has bolstered their cause. Immigration consultant Shamsher Singh Sandhu notes that many students from Punjab lack technical skills, putting them at a disadvantage in meeting the requirements for Canadian permanent residency, particularly the Canadian Experience Class (CRS) score.

With federal elections approaching in 2025, immigration policy is becoming a critical issue in Canada. The outcome of these protests is uncertain, as the government has not indicated a willingness to change its immigration rules.",Education,152,555

Mint,2025-01-01 00:00:00,Koreas Presidential Aides Seek to Resign as Turmoil Continues,"South Koreas presidential advisers are seeking to resign en masse following a decision by Acting President Choi Sang-mok to appoint new judges to join the impeachment trial against President Yoon Suk Yeol.
The chief secretary, the director of national policy, the national security adviser and the special counsel for foreign affairs and security are among those who have expressed their intent to step down, Yonhap News reported Wednesday. The presidential office in a text message confirmed the development. The aides had sought to step down once earlier but their offers of resignation were not accepted by either the president or prime minister.
Choi on Tuesday approved the appointment of two new judges to the Constitutional Court, taking the total number of justices to eight. That raised the likelihood of a ruling to finalize the removal of Yoon, who has been suspended from power by parliament for declaring martial law on Dec. 3.
Prime Minister Han Duck-soo took over from Yoon and he has also been impeached by an opposition-controlled parliament after he refused to quickly approve the appointment of three judges. Choi is the second acting president since Yoon was impeached on Dec. 14.
A South Korean court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for Yoon, who is under criminal investigation for insurrection allegations. Yoon denies those charges and has pledged to fight in court. His lawyer has told reporters the warrant for Yoon is illegal and invalid.
As the political turmoil continues, South Korea is in a week-long mourning period over the Jeju Air plane crash on Sunday that killed all but two of the 181 people on board.

The case, initiated by the local lawyer Balraj Bhati, accuses District Magistrate Manish Kumar Verma and Railway Board Chairperson Jaya Varma Sinha and other officials.Balraj Bhati alleges that he owns 10 hectares of land in Chamarawali Ramgarh village, and his father and cousin are the co-owners of the land. The Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) Railway was unable to acquire 4 hectares out of the total 20 hectares between 2018 and 2021.

This soil was used in the construction of the New Bodaki Junction; according to the information available, it reduced Bhati’s fields to a state where they could not be cultivated any more due to severe erosion.Bhati filed a complaint to the local police, but after they failed to act after she contacted emergency services, she petitioned the Chief Judicial Magistrate. He sought justice by citing sections of the Indian Citizen Security Code 2023. The court has fixed a date for hearing on October 22 and has sought a report from Dadri police station in this connection.

Following a megatrends strategy, the fund seeks to capitalise on existing and emerging opportunities in sectors related to the healthcare theme, such as hospitals, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, nutrition, and more.The New Fund Offer period for this scheme began on December 6th, 2024, and will end on December 20th, 2024.Let’s explore the current and upcoming shifts in these sectors that make this a potentially advantageous time to invest.Evolution of healthcare in India
Health and wellness in India have a rich history. Ancient practices such as Ayurveda and Yoga still hold relevance today and are now accompanied by innovation and advancements in modern medicine too. As a result, India is today a hub for traditional medicine as well as modern healthcare, with world-class hospitals, state-of-the-art diagnostic centres and a thriving pharmaceutical industry.

Healthcare boom post-Covid
The Covid-19 pandemic was a wake-up call for the global healthcare ecosystem. In India, it acted as a catalyst for rapid growth across multiple sub-sectors.

●        Vaccines: India emerged as a vaccine powerhouse, supplying doses globally.

●        Diagnostics: The pandemic highlighted the importance of early detection, driving investments in advanced diagnostic technologies.

●        Hospitals: Demand for quality healthcare facilities surged, leading to the expansion of hospitals and specialised care centres.

●        Nutrition and wellness: An increased awareness about health has led to a growing demand for nutrition and wellness products.

This momentum has continued post-pandemic, with increased public awareness, higher healthcare spending, and policy support driving growth
Key sectors driving growth in healthcare
The Indian healthcare sector is vast, with multiple sub-sectors presenting attractive investment opportunities:
Pharmaceuticals: India is a key player in global drug manufacturing.
Hospitals and healthcare facilities: The demand for quality infrastructure is growing, fuelled by urbanisation and an aging population.
Health insurance: Increasing awareness has led to higher penetration of health insurance.
Nutraceuticals: Rising health consciousness has boosted the demand for dietary supplements and functional foods.
Diagnostic laboratories: Advanced testing and early detection services are witnessing exponential growth.
CRAMS (Contract Research and Manufacturing Services): India is a preferred destination for global pharmaceutical research and manufacturing outsourcing.

Wellness and lifestyle management: The increasing prevalence of lifestyle diseases such as diabetes and heart conditions has driven demand for preventive care and wellness products.

Medical tourism: India is emerging as a favoured destination for medical tourism, owing to its high-quality services at relatively affordable prices.

Over the last decade, the healthcare sector has outperformed the broader market over multiple horizons in the last decade, as per a study by Bajaj Finserv AMC. Here’s why it remains a compelling investment:

Relatively stable return potential: The sector has offered steady growth over the last 15 years, as per the study. This can make it suitable for long-term investors seeking relatively stable return potential.

Lower volatility: Healthcare investments have largely registered lower downside risks as compared to the broader market in the last 10 years.

Healthy fundamentals: With growing demand, policy support, and strong financial performance, the sector is poised for growth.

The Bajaj Finserv Healthcare Fund follows the MEGATRENDS strategy, which focuses on long-term growth drivers shaping the sector. Megatrends are widespread changes that can have lasting impact on societies and economies across the world. Here are some of the megatrends that this fund will focus on:

1. Regulatory megatrends: The Biosecure Act, 2024 is expected to double the CRAMS segment in India.

2. Economic megatrends: India’s economic growth is fuelling increased healthcare spending. Health insurance, which is currently underpenetrated in India, is likely to witness growth

3. Demographic megatrends: India’s population dynamics present unique opportunities. An aging population, growing life expectancy and a young demographic that is increasingly adopting preventive healthcare measures are likely to create balanced demand across the spectrum.

4. Social megatrends: The shift in societal attitudes towards wellness and lifestyle management is creating new avenues for growth.

This partnership signifies a massive leap forward in the collaboration between two nations with an ever-growing strategic relationship. This move is expected to provide India with enhanced defense capabilities, better technology, and, importantly, a pathway to self-reliance in aircraft manufacturing.

With the defense industry seeing increasing importance in global geopolitics, countries like India are seeking to build a robust defense infrastructure while reducing dependency on foreign suppliers. This new aircraft manufacturing facility, backed by a joint effort between India and Spain, is a significant stride toward India’s goal of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” (Self-Reliant India) in defense manufacturing. But what does this new collaboration mean for India, Spain, and the broader global defense landscape? Let’s dive in!","The Growing Need for Self-Reliance in Defense Manufacturing India’s drive toward self-reliance in defense manufacturing has been a long-standing goal, especially in the face of increasing security challenges in the region. Historically, India has depended on foreign countries for procuring military equipment, which has led to concerns over delays, rising costs, and limited control over critical technologies. The move to establish a new aircraft manufacturing facility is part of India’s strategy to reduce reliance on external defense suppliers while boosting domestic production capabilities. This shift towards self-sufficiency is not just about cutting costs; it’s about fostering technological innovation, creating jobs, and building a robust defense ecosystem within the country. The new facility, which will focus on producing advanced aircraft components, is poised to enhance India’s domestic manufacturing prowess and position the country as a more formidable player on the global defense stage.",International News,142,136
Mint,2024-12-27 00:00:00,"Google reportedly uses Anthropics Claude to improve Gemini AI, sparks debate","Google is reportedly utilising Claude, an AI system developed by Anthropic, to enhance the performance of its own AI model, Gemini. According toTechCrunch, contractors hired by Google are tasked with evaluating and comparing the outputs of Gemini and Claude in response to identical prompts. The assessments focus on criteria such as truthfulness, clarity, and verbosity, offering Google valuable insights to improve Geminis performance.
Reportedly, the process involves contractors receiving responses from both AI models for specific prompts. They then have up to 30 minutes to thoroughly evaluate and rate the quality of each response. This feedback allows Google to pinpoint areas where Gemini may need refinement. However, contractors have observed peculiar patterns during these evaluations. On occasion, Geminis responses have oddly included references such as I am Claude, created by Anthropic, raising questions about the models' interconnection.
The report highlights that one notable distinction in the comparisons is the models approach to safety. Claude is recognised for its firm stance on ethical boundaries, often refusing to engage with prompts it deems unsafe. In contrast, while Gemini also flags such inputs as violations, it provides more detailed explanations, albeit with a potentially less rigid approach. For instance, in cases involving sensitive topics like nudity or bondage, Claude opted for outright refusal, whereas Gemini elaborated on the safety concerns.
As per the report, Google uses an internal platform to facilitate these model comparisons, enabling contractors to test and review AI systems side by side. However, the involvement of Claude has sparked debate. Anthropics terms of service prohibit using Claude to train competing AI products without prior approval. While this restriction applies to external companies, it remains unclear whether it extends to financial backers like Google, which has invested in Anthropic.
Shira McNamara, a spokesperson for Google DeepMind, addressed the speculation, calling model comparisons a standard industry practice, reported India Today. She categorically denied claims that Claude had been used to train Gemini, labelling such suggestions as inaccurate.

The new Indian express ,2024-10-17 00:00:00,"Detect, deport illegal Bangladeshi immigrants chorus in Assam after SC's Section 6A judgment","GUWAHATI: Opposition parties and various organisations in Assam on Thursday demanded that the government begin the process of detecting and deporting the illegal Bangladeshi immigrants who entered the state after March 24, 1971.

The demand stemmed from the Supreme Court’s judgement. The court upheld Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, validating the 1971 cut-off date for granting Indian citizenship to the immigrants.

The 1971 cut-off date is linked to the Assam Accord of 1985, signed between the then Rajiv Gandhi government and the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) at the end of the six-year-long bloody Assam Agitation. The Accord says the illegal immigrants, irrespective of faith who entered Assam after March 24, 1971, are to be detected and deported.

Some opposition parties demanded that Assam be kept outside the purview of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), pointing out that it comes in conflict with the 1971 cut-off date.
By implementing CAA, the Centre sought to grant Indian citizenship to people from six non-Muslim communities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan who migrated to India till December 31, 2014.
Congress, All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), Raijor Dal, Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) besides AASU and Assam Public Works (APW) welcomed the Supreme Court’s judgement.

“With this judgement, the court has ended the debate on whether 1971 or 1951 should be the basis to detect and deport foreigners. The government should drive out all illegal immigrants who came to Assam after March 25, 1971,” AASU president Utpal Sarma demanded.

He said the AASU as well as the BJP governments at the Centre and in Assam were not happy when only 19 lakh people were left out of the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“We moved the court seeking re-verification (of documents of NRC applicants) but the BJP governments did not. We demand that they file an affidavit in the court seeking re-verification. They should also speed up detecting the illegal immigrants who came after March 25, 1971 and drive them out,” Sarma categorically said.

State Congress chief Bhupen Kumar Borah viewed the judgement as the court reposing its faith in the historic Assam Accord. AIUDF MLA Rafiqul Islam observed that the court solved a long-standing issue.

“After this judgement, we want the government not to rehabilitate the post-1971 stream of immigrants in Assam. If the BJP loves them so much, it can rehabilitate them in Gujarat or other places,” Islam said.

Activist-turned-Raijor Dal chief Akhil Gogoi urged the people of the state to accept the court’s judgement.

“The people of Assam have no other option but to accept this judgement. They will now have to unitedly decide on the deportation of all immigrants, irrespective of faith, who came to Assam after March 24, 1971,” Gogoi said.

AJP chief Lurinjyoti Gogoi said since the court validated 1971 as the base year to detect and deport illegal immigrants, the Centre should take steps to repeal CAA in Assam and implement Clause 6 of the Assam Accord forthright.

Clause 6 of the Accord says, “Constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards, as may be appropriate, shall be provided to protect, preserve and promote the cultural, social, linguistic identity and heritage of the Assamese people.”

The APW, an NGO and one of the main petitioners for the updation of NRC, welcomed the court’s judgement but, at the same time, demanded 100% re-verification of NRC documents.

“The Central and Assam governments should file an affidavit in the Supreme Court seeking re-verification,” APW chief Abhijit Sarma said.","At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Dushanbe on July 14, 2021, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted the negative impact of the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on bilateral relations during discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. In another development, a report revealed that Haryana registered 60,397 excess deaths from April 2020 to May 2021, significantly higher than the 8,303 officially reported COVID-19 deaths for the same period. This discrepancy raises concerns about the accuracy of the state's COVID-19 data. Additionally, there is growing speculation within Congress about a prominent figure's potential formal joining of the party, amidst ongoing discussions involving party leaders Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.",National News,123,576
Hindustan Times,2024-07-16 00:00:00,Why is upcoming bypoll in Uttar Pradesh a litmus test for BJP?,"The polls gain significance in view of the party’s performance in the Lok Sabha elections in the state, where its seats dropped to 33 from the 62.After winning two of the 13 assembly seats in recent by-elections across seven states, the upcoming bypolls in 10 seats of Uttar Pradesh will be a crucial test for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to regain ground.The polls gain significance in light of the party’s performance in the Lok Sabha elections in the state, where its seats dropped to 33 from the 62 it secured in 2019, and its vote share decreased to 41.3 percent from 50 percent.Meanwhile, the party is also looking to increase its members in the Rajya Sabha, where its strength has come down to 86 from 90 for the first time in many years, following the end of the term for four non-aligned members.

The National Democratic Alliance now has 101 seats, which is below the majority mark of 113 in the 245-member House.

The assembly seats in Uttar Pradesh have fallen vacant after nine members, including Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, were elected to the Lok Sabha, and SP MLA Irfan Solanki from Sisamau in Kanpur was disqualified due to a jail sentence in a criminal case.In 2022, five of these 10 seats were won by the Samajwadi Party, while the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) in alliance with the SP secured one seat. On the other hand, the BJP secured three seats, and one seat was won by their ally, the Nishad Party.

Although the RLD has now joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA), the Congress and SP, both constituents of the INDIA bloc, have decided to jointly contest the bypolls.

The Bharatiya Janata Party had maintained a strong dominance in the Uttar Pradesh, not only in the previous two Lok Sabha polls, but also the state polls coming to power at its own with a brute majority in the 403-member House.

Among the seats of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly scheduled for bypolls include Milkipur, which fell vacant after Samajwadi Party leader Awadhesh Prasad was elected to the Lok Sabha from Ayodhya.Prasad, a nine-time MLA and former minister from the scheduled caste community secured victory by over 55,000 votes, defeating two-time BJP MP Lallu Singh.

The BJP was confident of winning the Faizabad seat in view of the Ram Mandir, but it suffered a major setback. 

Another seat Katehari has become vacant after Samajwadi Party’s Lalji Verma was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Ambedkar Nagar constituency. SP chief Akhilesh Yadav resigned from the Karhal assembly seat in Mainpuri after winning the Lok Sabha seat from Kannauj.

Chandan Chauhan of Rashtriya Lok Dal resigned from his Meerapur assembly seat of Muzaffarnagar following his election to Lok Sabha from Bijnor.

BJP’s Anoop Singh, who is also known as Anoop Pradhan Balmiki stepped down from his assembly seat in Khair after winning the Hathras Lok Sabha seat. Praveen Patel resigned from the Phulpur assembly seat in Prayagraj after being elected to the Lok Sabha from the Phulpur constituency on a BJP ticket.The other seats that will go to polls in the by-elections are Ghaziabad, Majhawan, Sisamau and Kundarki. 

In the current Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, the BJP holds 249 seats, with its ally Apna Dal (S) having 13 seats. The Rashtriya Lok Dal holds eight seats, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party has six, and the Nirbal Indian Shoshit Hamara Aam Dal (NISHAD) has five seats.

In opposition, the Samajwadi Party (SP) holds 103 seats, while the Congress has two. Additionally, there are two members from the Jansatta Dal (Loktantrik) and one member from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).","The upcoming bypolls in 10 seats of Uttar Pradesh are crucial for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it seeks to regain ground after a decline in the Lok Sabha elections, where its seats dropped from 62 to 33. The party's vote share also decreased from 50% to 41.3%. The BJP's strength in the Rajya Sabha has also reduced from 90 to 86. The vacant assembly seats resulted from several members being elected to the Lok Sabha and one disqualification.

The Indian Express,2024-07-01 00:00:00,"After hijab, now Mumbai college bans jeans, T-shirt","On Monday, students of Acharya & Marathe College in Chembur sporting jeans and T-shirt were in for a rude shock as they were stopped from entering the college.

Reason? The college issued a new dress code banning jeans and T-shirt, days after the Bombay High Court dismissed a plea filed by students of the college, challenging the institute’s dress code banning hijab and other religious identifiers that it issued last year.

According to the notice by the college titled “dress code and other rules” dated June 27, torn-jeans, T-shirts, revealing dresses and jerseys are not allowed.


The notice, signed by Principal of the college Dr. Vidyagauri Lele, states, “Students should wear formal and decent dress while on campus. They can wear a half-shirt or full-shirt and trousers. Girls can wear any Indian or western outfit. Students shall not wear any dress which shows religion or cultural disparity. Nakab, hijab, burkha, stole, cap, badge etc shall be removed by going to common rooms on the ground floor and then only they can move throughout the college campus.”

Ateeque Khan from Govandi Citizens Association, who was approached by many students, said, “Last year they banned hijab. This year they have banned jeans and t-shirts which are very commonly worn by not only college-going youngsters but by all irrespective of religion and gender. We do not understand what they are trying to impose on the students by bringing such impractical dress-codes.”

However, according to the college, the administration is preparing them to be ready for the corporate world. Principal of the College Dr. Lele said, “We just want students to wear decent clothes. We have not brought in any uniform, but have asked them to wear formal Indian or western clothes. After all, they will be expected to wear those once they are employed.”

Dr. Lele said the dress code was informed to students at the time of admissions and she cannot fathom why they should raise concerns about it now. “Out of 365 days of the year, students hardly have to be in college for 120-130 days. What problem should they have to adhere to a dress code for these days?” she said adding that it was multiple instances of indecent behavior on campus by students which led the administration to bring out the new dress code.


In the last academic session, the college introduced uniforms for students from the junior college section, which banned hijab among other religious identifiers. Students were asked to remove hijab or niqab at a designated place in college after entering the gate. Nine students had moved the Bombay High Court against the ban. But their plea was dismissed by the HC last month stating that larger academic interest doesn’t violate rights.

Earlier in May, the Chembur college was under the scanner for issuing a dress-code for students from its degree college section too. According to students, while the dress code in May stipulates that burkha, niqab, hijab, or any religious identifiers such as badges, caps, or stoles will not be permitted inside the college, the new code declared on June 27 banned jeans and t-shirt too.","Acharya & Marathe College in Chembur enforced a new dress code banning jeans, T-shirts, and religious attire like hijabs, sparking student outrage. The move follows the Bombay High Court’s dismissal of a plea challenging last year’s hijab ban. The college notice, issued June 27, requires students to wear formal, decent attire and remove religious identifiers in designated rooms. Critics argue the code is impractical and restrictive, while Principal Dr. Lele defends it as preparation for corporate life and a response to past indecent behavior. The dress code was informed at admission and applies during the limited days students attend college.

The Statesman,2024-09-03 00:00:00,South Park Street Cemetery undergoes plaque restoration with community support,"If you find yourself near Mullick Bazaar in Kolkata, or venture well beyond Allen Park heading southward, you will undoubtedly encounter one of the earliest non-church cemeteries in the world, and arguably the most magnificent Christian necropolis outside the domains of Europe and America in the 19th century- the South Park Street Cemetery.

Established in 1767, this burial ground ceased operations in 1840 due to the lack of space for further interments. Today, the site is carefully maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as a cherished heritage site.

Despite this preservation, the plaques on the tombs have weathered the passage of time. The Calcutta Restorers have embarked on a mission to restore these plaques, funded through crowdfunding efforts and with the requisite approval from the Christian Burial Board.

Mudar Patherya, while speaking with The Statesman, shared his vision and progress on the restoration of over 400 plaques at the 257-year-old South Park Street Cemetery. “We anticipate completing the restoration by 30 November. While the project has faced minimal challenges, securing adequate funding remains a concern,” Patherya notes, adding that if public donations fall short, he may have to cover costs from his own pocket.

Patherya further emphasised the use of extremely benign and tested materials to maintain the original integrity of the plaques, including a combination of plain water and mild soap that has no adverse impact on the quality of the marble. “We are proceeding based on the geographical layout of the cemetery. We began with the right avenue and, once that is completed, we’ll move on to the left avenue. We continue to work systematically, avenue by avenue, restoring all plaques within each section, regardless of their size or significance,” he added.

The tombs at the South Park Street Cemetery, poised atop robust brick plinths, exhibit a peerless synthesis of architectural forms—whether square, rectangular or circular, each crowned by domed roofs. These are graced by Corinthian or Ionic columns that support an entablature within the pediment. The array of monuments range from towering obelisks to cairns and intricately carved stone urns resting upon fluted columns. Yet, it is the exquisite sarcophagi that command attention, each reflecting a fusion of Gothic influences and the rich nuances of the Indo-Saracenic style. Particularly noteworthy is a distinctive composite brick structure constructed in the ‘panchayatana’ style, featuring a central dome flanked by miniature replicas of Orissan ‘rekha deul’ on all sides. The black basalt carvings adorning the frontal façade, a tribute to Hindu faith, add an intriguing dimension of cultural confluence to this architectural ensemble.

There is certainly a rational explanation for the lavish use of masonry. Beginning in the 18th century, there was a widespread awareness in scientific circles regarding the potential of deceased bodies to transmit contagious diseases. The spectre of tropical diseases, unrelenting fevers, and grim epidemics loomed large over the era, offering no respite. As Theon Wilkinson pointed out in Two Monsoons (1976), in a single year in Calcutta, more than a third of the total population of 1,200 individuals would perish between August and the end of December.

Amidst the obelisks, one stands out not only for its imposing height but also for the profound significance it carries. Erected in 1796, it is dedicated to the remains of Sir William Jones, the visionary founder of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta.

Among the other notable graves are the resting places of individuals such as Rose Aylmer, who held a cherished place in the heart of poet Walter Savage Landor. The cemetery also houses the tomb of Henry Louis Vivian Derozio, the driving force behind the Young Bengal Movement, whose impactful life spanned a mere 22 years. Additionally, one encounters the final resting grounds of the Scottish poet and scholar David Drummond; Colonel Robert Kyd, the British officer who founded the botanical garden in Calcutta; and Colonel Colin Mackenzie, the first Surveyor General of India. In this sacred expanse, one can also find the final resting place of Charles Stuart (1758-1828), an East India Company officer famously known as ‘Hindoo Stuart’. Distinguished among his peers, he earned this epithet due to his remarkable embrace of Indian culture. Notably, he expressed a desire for his tomb to be crafted in the ‘panchayatana’ style—a request that was honoured, with his grave today standing as an attestation to this unique fusion of cultural influences.

Looking ahead, Mudar Patherya of The Calcutta Restorers hinted at future projects, including potentially expanding restoration efforts to other cemeteries in Kolkata, such as the Lower Circular Road Cemetery, the Scottish Cemetery and the Greek Cemetery, depending on their needs.

","The South Park Street Cemetery in Kolkata, established in 1767, is undergoing a significant restoration led by Mudar Patherya and the Calcutta Restorers. This historic cemetery, once a prominent Christian necropolis, stopped accepting new burials in 1840 and is now managed by the Archaeological Survey of India. The restoration project aims to refurbish over 400 weathered plaques by November 30, with funding secured through crowdfunding and personal contributions by Patherya if necessary. The cemetery features elaborate tombs and mausoleums with Gothic and Indo-Saracenic influences, including the notable obelisk dedicated to Sir William Jones. Future projects may extend to other cemeteries in Kolkata if needs arise.",Local News,105,763

According to police, the suspects had recently demanded extortion of ₹1 crore from a hotel owner on the Delhi-Jaipur Highway. The gang members were reportedly on their way to commit a crime when they were intercepted by police who were acting on a tip off. Police recovered two countrymade pistols and cartridges from the suspects’ possession.A senior police officer said that the injured suspects were admitted to a hospital while the other two are currently being questioned. A first information report has been registered under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNS) and the Arms Act at Manesar Police Station.

Probationer SI Sumit Kumar, head of the crime unit in Palam Vihar, filed the complaint in this case. In the FIR , seen by HT, Kumar said that late Wednesday night he received information that four armed henchmen of gangster Kaushal were travelling in a grey Eeco van to Dharuhera to commit a crime. PSI Kumar informed inspector Vishw Gaurav, head of the crime unit, Sector 39, and together, the two police teams set up barricades on both sides of the Delhi-Jaipur Highway near the NSG camp in Manesar.


“At approximately 3.50am, the grey Eeco van was spotted approaching from Bilaspur. When the police signalled the van to stop, the driver attempted to flee, opening fire on the police. The driver then tried to escape through the service lane, but the van got stuck in a drain near the service lane, halting their escape,” said PSI Sumit Kumar in his complaint.

The driver and one associate exited the van and began shooting at the police, while the other two criminals remained inside the vehicle. During the exchange of gunfire, a bullet struck SI Harish Kumar in the chest, but he was unharmed due to his bulletproof vest. The police shot the two suspects in the legs and arrested them along with the other two suspects in the van.


The arrested suspects were identified as Sachin alias Gajnu, 28, Krishan Singh, 30, Sanjay Singh, 31, and Anish 30.

“In the encounter, Sachin sustained a gunshot wound to his left leg while Krishan was shot in his right leg. We have seized the Eeco van and the weapons.

The couple took to social media to release a joint statement on their separation. The separation comes after four years of being together as a couple. The couple added that they will co-parent their son, Agastya, together. Speculations were rife after Natasa removed her ‘Pandya’ surname from social media, deleted all photos together and was also absent during the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 and ICC T20 World Cup 2024. ADVERTISEMENT The couple released a joint post on social media. “After 4 years of being together, Natasa and I have decided to mutually part ways. We tried our best together and gave it our all, and we believe this is in the best interest for the both of us. This was a tough decision for us to make, given the joy, mutual respect and companionship we enjoyed together and as we grew a family,” the post read.

We sincerely request your support and understanding to give us privacy during this difficult and sensitive time,” the statement added.

Just hours before the statement on social media was posted, Natasa shared a photo of her home and surroundings, in what can be understood as her hometown in Serbia. Things on the cricketing front also look bleak for Hardik as he was tipped to take over India’s T20 captaincy from Rohit Sharma but was dropped from the scheme of things in the eleventh hour. He was also stripped of his vice-captaincy post and it was given to Shubman Gill for the upcoming India’s tour of Sri Lanka. The 30-year-old Hardik’s fitness issues and his unimpressive way of leading the team, including strategising, has kept him out of favour from the new coach Gautam Gambhir and the chief of selectors Ajit Agarkar’s future plans and purview.

Britain's new Prime Minister Keir Starmer to set out his first package of proposed laws

The Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a peak of above 11% in late 2022.

Higher interest rates — which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow — have helped ease inflation, but they've also weighed on the British economy, which has barely grown since the pandemic rebound.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stressed that upping the U.K.'s economic growth will be the driving mission of his Labour government. Later Wednesday, his government will announce its plans for the coming year. Starmer said the measures announced in the King's Speech to Parliament would “take the brakes off Britain” and “create wealth for people up and down the country” by spurring economic growth.","UK inflation remained at 2% in June, potentially prompting Bank of England to cut rates. Upward price pressures from restaurants and hotels countered by discounts in clothing. Concerns over service sector costs and wage growth linger.

Indian Express,2024-12-31 00:00:00,Rajkot: Police on lookout for man who wrote abusive words on car ‘to frame’ African student,"A near-accident between a bike being driven by a student from Liberia and a car with a local resident at the wheel escalated into the car driver allegedly attacking the student with a stick and a few people of the neighbouring village later accusing the foreigner of writing swear words on the car, police said.

The incident took place on the outskirts of Rajkot on Saturday. Although no FIR has been filed in the matter, police said they are looking for the man who allegedly wrote the abusive words.

They further termed the accusation against the foreigner an attempt “to frame the students and raise an issue against them”. According to police, Jefferson, who has been identified by only one name, was on his way back from the market along with his two sisters when his bike almost ran into the car being driven by one Ravi in Gauridad village. Ravi got out of his car and engaged in a spat with the student of Marwadi University before hitting him with a stick on the chest, according to a statement from Kuvadva road police station on Sunday. Ravi then fled from the spot, leaving his car behind.

Meanwhile, on getting to know about the incident, a few students from Jefferson’s university arrived at the spot.

Around this time, 25 residents of the village also gathered near the abandoned car. The villagers alleged that the foreign students had carved swear words against Indians on the dust on the car’s windshield. However, the students denied the allegation, stating they had video footage of the entire incident from the moment Ravi fled the spot.

“The video shows a local man writing the swear words abusing Indians. The police are attempting to nab this person,” said the statement from the police.The police said the issue stemmed from a three-year-old dispute between the people of Gauridad village and some foreign students after which the entire village had resolved not to give homes to African students on rent.

Based on Saturday’s incident, an application was filed at Kuvadva police station by the African students of the university and further investigation is underway. Naresh Jadeja, registrar of Marwadi University, told The Indian Express, “The incident that happened on Saturday night following a road accident was reported to the police by the students. Nobody was injured or harmed but it involved a verbal dispute. Since students were not at fault, we are with them. The police called both the parties and resolved the issue.” Inspector BP Rajya of Kuvadva Road police station said, “We have not converted the application into an FIR because the students decided against it in the larger interest of peace. However, we have recorded their statements as well as that of the car owner (who was later tracked down). We are still looking to apprehend the person who wrote the abuses on the car.”","A near-accident in Rajkot escalated into a physical altercation and accusations between a foreign student from Liberia and a local resident.

the new indian express	,2025-01-03 00:00:00,Biden announces blocking sale of US Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has rejected the nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase Pittsburgh-based US Steel — affirming his vow in March to block the acquisition.

""We need major US companies representing the major share of US steelmaking capacity to keep leading the fight on behalf of America's national interests,"" Biden said in a Friday morning statement.

His decision comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last month, and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden who had 15 days to reach a final decision.

The committee, chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and made up of other Cabinet members, can recommend that the president block a transaction, and federal law gives the president that power.

A US official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press last month that some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.

The decision, which comes just weeks before the Democratic president is set to leave office, could potentially damage relations between the US and Japan, which is America's biggest ally in Asia.

Japan is also the largest foreign holder of US debt.

Biden previously came out against the deal last March — and was backed by the United Steelworkers, concerned over whether the company would honor existing labor agreements or slash jobs as well as the firm's financial transparency.

""It is important that we maintain strong American steel companies powered by American steel workers,"" Biden said in a March statement, while he was still seeking reelection to the presidency before dropping out of the race.

""US Steel has been an iconic American steel company for more than a century, and it is vital for it to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated,"" he added.

US President-elect Donald Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed in December on his Truth Social platform to block the deal and to use tax incentives and tariffs to grow the company.

Steelworkers' union President David McCall said last month that the union welcomed Trump's opposition to the sale and said ""it's time for this deal to be rejected so we can all focus on the future.""

Nippon Steel announced in December that it planned to buy the Pennsylvania steel producer for $14.1 billion in cash — and despite committing to keep the US Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters — its proposal raised concerns about what the transaction could mean for unionized workers, supply chains and US national security.

Still, the deal had many supporters, including lawmakers and business groups like the US Chamber.

Mike Pompeo, who served as Trump's first secretary of state called a potential rejection of the deal ""shortsighted"" in the Wall Street Journal.

""The deal would strengthen US Steel's current operations and production capacity, benefit its workers and their communities, and enhance the competitiveness of the American steel industry,"" he wrote in December.
","US President Joe Biden has rejected Nippon Steel's $15 billion proposal to acquire US Steel, emphasizing the need to preserve American steelmaking capacity for national security and economic interests. The decision follows a report by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which raised concerns about potential national security risks. The deal faced opposition from steelworkers’ unions and bipartisan political leaders, including President-elect Donald Trump, citing job security and transparency issues. Despite Nippon Steel’s commitment to retain US Steel’s name and headquarters, critics viewed the acquisition as a threat to domestic operations. Business groups, however, supported the merger’s economic potential.",Business and Finance,101,525

The recent surge of cases of respiratory illness in China is not unusual in view of the ongoing flu season, the Union Health Ministry said on Saturday, following a meeting of the joint monitoring group convened to review the situation. There has been no unusual rise in respiratory illnesses or influenza cases in Indian hospitals, it said.

The reports from China suggest that the cause of the present surge in cases there are Influenza viruses -- Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) -- which are expected during the season, the Ministry said in a statement.

 Understanding Human Metapneumovirus, as cases emerge from China: Explained

Noting that it is keeping a close watch over the situation through all available channels, the Ministry added that it has requested the World Health Organization (WHO) to share timely updates regarding the situation in China.

‘No unusual surge’
“These viruses are already in circulation globally including India. A robust surveillance system for Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) for Influenza is already in place in India and the data from both indicates no unusual surge in ILI & SARI cases. Physicians from hospitals also confirmed that there is no surge in respiratory illness cases in the last few weeks other than the expected seasonal variation,’’ it said.

The Health Ministry added that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) network also tests for other respiratory viruses such as Adenovirus, RSV, HMPV etc. and these pathogens also do not show an unusual increase in the tested samples. As a precautionary measure, the number of laboratories testing for HMPV will be enhanced by ICMR, and ICMR will be monitoring trends of HMPV for the entire year.

 No HMPV cases in Telangana, says director of Public Health

Data from the recently conducted preparedness drill across the country indicated that India is well prepared to deal with any increase in respiratory illnesses, said the Ministry.

The meeting saw the participation of top experts from the Health Ministry, WHO, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme, National Centre for Disease Control, ICMR and doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.

I wanted the second one be here, in a prison,"" Francis told the inmates before he entered. “I wanted each of us here, inside and out, to have the possibility of throwing open the door of our hearts and understanding that hope doesn't disappoint.”
Francis dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to hope and has made clear that prisoners were an important part of the Holy Year: The final grand event of the Jubilee is a special Mass for inmates at St. Peter's on Dec. 14, 2025. Francis has long made prison ministry an important part of his priestly vocation and has made several visits to Rebibbia since becoming pope in 2013.
His message, also delivered to inmates during his foreign trips, is always one of hope, believing that people who are serving prison sentences need something to look forward to more than most.","Pope Francis inaugurated the 2025 Jubilee Year by opening the Holy Door at Rome's Rebibbia prison, emphasizing hope and inclusion for inmates. This marked the second Holy Door opening, following St. Peter's Basilica on Christmas Eve, officially starting the Catholic tradition held every 25 years since 1300. The Jubilee is expected to draw 32 million pilgrims to Rome.
At the prison, Francis encouraged inmates to ""throw open the door of our hearts,"" affirming that hope never disappoints. He has dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to hope, highlighting the significance of prisoners in the celebration. The Holy Year will culminate with a special Mass for inmates at St. Peter's on December 14, 2025.
Known for prioritizing prison ministry, Francis has visited Rebibbia multiple times since becoming pope in 2013, consistently delivering messages of hope to those serving sentences, stressing the importance of providing them with something to look forward to.",Religion and Spirituality,148,301
Mint,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Jürgen Klopp’s masterclass in how to win—and lose,"An obvious way to recount Jürgen Klopp’s time as manager of Liverpool, one of the grandest clubs in the world’s most popular sport, is in titles and accolades. Between his first match in 2015 and his last on May 19th, he won seven major trophies. But a neater encapsulation of the German coach’s impact lies in a pair of gestures. Together they form a pictographic guide to management in football and beyond—and even to a philosophy of life.

The first gesture is an alpha-male expression of triumph. After big wins at Anfield, Liverpool’s home ground, Mr Klopp skipped over to the Kop, a grandstand which, even at a club followed more fervently than most, is known for its passionate supporters. To adoring roars, he punched the air once, twice, three times. Then he thumped the Liverpool badge on his chest. The fist pump was both a party and a promise. We did it—and we’ll do it again.

Mr Klopp’s other signature move—a bear hug—befitted commiseration as much as celebration. He hugged his players whether they won or not. He hugged them whether they performed well or badly (or didn’t get onto the pitch at all). Often he hugged the opposition, generally after beating them.

","Jürgen Klopp’s tenure as Liverpool’s manager, starting in 2015, is marked by seven major trophies, but his true impact is illustrated through two signature gestures. His triumphant fist pumps towards the Kop after big wins at Anfield symbolize celebration and a commitment to future victories. Conversely, Klopp’s affectionate bear hugs, given to players and even opponents regardless of the match outcome, reflect his supportive and inclusive approach. These gestures encapsulate his management style and life philosophy, highlighting a balance of triumph and empathy.",Sports,83,204

Report says she is likely to contest against...,"Ace wrestler Vinesh Phogat is likely to contest the upcoming Haryana Assembly elections, sources close to her told IANS on Tuesday. However, Vinesh had stated earlier that she will not move into active politics. But as per the latest report, some political parties are trying hard to ""convince"" her. Vinesh missed the opportunity to win a gold medal in women's freestyle 50kg category in the Paris Olympics after getting disqualified from the final for being 100gm overweight.

Vinesh received a rousing welcome in the National Capital and her village Balali, Sonipat on Saturday. She was garlanded by Congress Member of Parliament, Deepender Hooda and other members of his family at the Indira Gandhi International Airport. However, which party Vinesh is going to join is yet to be confirmed.

""Yes, why not? It's likely that in Haryana assembly you see Vinesh Phogat vs Babita Phogat and Bajrang Punia vs Yogeshwar Dutt. Some politicial parties are trying to convince her,"" sources close to Phogat family told IANS when asked about 2024 Olympic finalist wrestler's future plans.
As Vinesh exited the airport, she was met with loud cheers from her fans, family, and friends, who had gathered in large numbers despite the early hours. The overwhelming support and affection brought the wrestling icon to tears.

Outside the airport, emotions ran high as people celebrated. Among the first to welcome Vinesh home were Sakshi Malikkh, who retired from wrestling last year, and Bajrang Punia.

In a poignant moment, Vinesh and Sakshi, both of whom have faced significant challenges in their careers, embraced and broke down in tears, sharing the weight of their struggles.

""Our fight has not ended and the fight will continue and I pray to god that the truth will prevail,"" Vinesh had said on Saturday.

On Friday, Vinesh expressed her deep sorrow over missing out on the Olympic podium, linking her personal disappointment to the broader struggle for women's rights in India, a cause she championed in her protests against the former wrestling federation chief.

In a three-page letter posted on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) on Friday night, Vinesh hinted at a possible return to the sport, leaving the door slightly open despite her earlier decision to retire after the Paris Olympics disqualification.

Despite the team's efforts, Vinesh was unable to make weight in time for the weigh-in, leading to her disqualification from the gold medal match. Her appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for a joint silver medal was later dismissed on Wednesday.","Wrestler Vinesh Phogat is considering entering Haryana Assembly elections, despite previously stating she would not pursue active politics.

The New Indian Express,2024-12-29 00:00:00,South Korea Plane Crash: What do we know so far?,"All except two of the 181 people on board the Jeju Air flight from Bangkok are presumed dead after the aircraft crashed during an emergency landing at Muan International Airport in South Korea on Sunday morning, according to Yonhap News.

What has happened?
The accident occurred at 9:07 a.m. local time during the plane’s second attempt to land after a failed initial approach. Officials said a malfunction in the landing gear likely prevented a safe landing.“The front landing gear did not appear to deploy, forcing the aircraft into a crash landing,” a fire department official explained. Footage from local TV showed the plane skidding uncontrollably across the runway before slamming into a fence. Witnesses described thick black smoke billowing from the wreckage as flames consumed the aircraft.

Where did it happen?
The crash occurred at Muan International Airport, located in South Jeolla Province in southwestern South Korea. Emergency services temporarily closed the airport as they worked to contain the fire and rescue survivors.Landing gear failure suspected
The Jeju Air flight, en route from Bangkok to South Korea, carried 181 passengers and six crew members. The plane reportedly faced issues with its front landing gear, which likely failed to deploy during its final approach to Muan International Airport, according to a report by Yonhap news agency.Authorities stated the aircraft attempted an emergency landing after a failed initial attempt but veered off the runway, colliding with a concrete fence at around 9:07 a.m. local time. Witnesses and footage from the scene showed the Boeing 737-800 skidding uncontrollably before erupting into flames.

Rescue efforts are underway
The resulting fire severely damaged the plane, with emergency responders describing it as “almost completely destroyed.” Firefighters used 32 fire trucks and helicopters to extinguish the blaze, but debris and flames made rescue operations challenging, reported by CNN.

Two survivors—a passenger and a crew member—were pulled alive from the wreckage, while the remaining victims succumbed to the fire and impact.International passengers on board
South Korea’s transport ministry confirmed that the passengers were primarily South Korean nationals, though two Thai nationals were among those onboard. Families of the victims have been notified as the nation mourns the loss of life.

Investigation is underway
An official investigation is ongoing to determine the exact cause of the crash. Preliminary findings suggest that a bird strike may have damaged the landing gear, leading to its failure.“We are committed to uncovering the cause of this tragedy and ensuring aviation safety,” said a transport ministry spokesperson.

Political turmoil adds to crisis
The crash occurred amid political instability in South Korea. Acting President Choi Sang-mok, who stepped into the role just two days earlier, has mobilised all available resources for rescue and recovery efforts.“This is a national tragedy, and we will prioritise providing support to the victims and their families,” Choi said in a statement.

Choi’s leadership comes during a period of turmoil, as President Yoon Suk Yeol was recently suspended following a controversial martial law decision. His interim replacement, Han Duck-soo, was impeached shortly thereafter, leaving Choi to lead the country during this critical moment.

The tragic crash has left South Korea grieving, with authorities vowing to uncover the causes and improve safety measures to prevent such incidents in the future.","A Jeju Air flight from Bangkok crashed at Muan International Airport in South Korea on Sunday morning, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.

The Statesman,2024-10-17 00:00:00,Tamannaah Bhatia questioned by ED in Guwahati over alleged links to illegal IPL betting platform,"Bollywood actress Tamannaah Bhatia appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Guwahati on Thursday for questioning regarding her alleged involvement in promoting illegal betting activities tied to the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Bollywood actress Tamannaah Bhatia appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in Guwahati on Thursday for questioning regarding her alleged involvement in promoting illegal betting activities tied to the Indian Premier League (IPL).

The actress was summoned for allegedly endorsing IPL match viewership on an app linked to Mahadev online gaming, which is currently under investigation for facilitating illegal betting operations.
Bhatia, who arrived at the ED office around 1:30 PM accompanied by her mother, was questioned well into the afternoon. The interrogation centered on her association with FairPlay, a betting exchange platform that offers a variety of gambling options, including sports betting.
FairPlay is a subsidiary of Mahadev online gaming, which has been under scrutiny for its involvement in illicit betting activities in both live sports and games of chance.

The Mahadev betting app gained national attention last year when Bollywood stars Ranbir Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor were questioned by the ED over their promotional involvement with the platform.

The investigation has since expanded, implicating several high-profile Bollywood figures for their alleged roles in endorsing betting platforms connected to Mahadev.

Officials have revealed that Mahadev is notorious for enabling illegal betting on various games, including cricket, football, and poker.

Saurabh Chandrakar, the app’s founder, remains at the center of the probe, as investigators attempt to establish the full extent of celebrity endorsements in relation to these illegal betting operations.

Earlier in 2024, Bollywood actor and fitness influencer Sahil Khan was arrested by the Mumbai Cyber Cell’s Special Investigating Team after his pre-arrest bail plea was rejected by the Bombay High Court. Khan, who had promoted the betting brand The Lion Book under a contract with Isports247, denied any direct involvement in illegal betting, claiming he was merely a brand ambassador.

In the past year, several other Bollywood personalities, including Shraddha Kapoor, Ranbir Kapoor, comedian Kapil Sharma, Huma Qureshi, and Hina Khan, have also been summoned by the ED as part of the broader investigation.

The agency is primarily focused on uncovering whether the payments received by these celebrities for promotional activities were derived from illegal betting revenues.

The crackdown on the Mahadev betting app is part of a larger campaign by the ED and law enforcement agencies to dismantle illegal online betting networks in India, a growing concern due to its links with prominent figures in the entertainment industry. With investigations still ongoing, further developments are expected in the coming weeks.

The Hindu,2024-12-24 00:00:00,Behind the scenes of the season of colours in Chennai,"Ammu R., who has been running a fruit shop on South Mada Street at Mylapore, eagerly awaits the Margazhi season more than any other. It is because during this time her stall gets a makeover, glowing brighter with colours of rangoli and kolam powders. “The rangoli powder will always be in stock at my shop, but the demand soars during Margazhi. We sell each box for ₹20,” says Ms. Ammu.

Steady business
She says the demand for the kolam colours has never waned, and year after year, the customers come steady. “A regular customer bought rangoli powders for ₹500,” she says, beaming. As she chats, more customers stream in, stacking their bags with boxes of the season’s must-have colours.

“People from all over Chennai flock to Mylapore for the colours because there is usually a spot where there is a box of every shade possible,” Ms. Ammu says. “And it is not just locals. We see visitors from abroad curious about kolam powders and the rangoli colours,” she adds.

A row of shops along the Mada Streets is brimming with hues and shades of kolam powders, a staple of the Margazhi season. On the corner of North Mada Street is R. Devi with her family; they juggle everything, from stringing flowers to selling sugar cane and small diyas throughout the year. But when it is December, the family mainly sells kolam powders, bringing large sacks from various markets in and around Chennai.

Many tasks
“I am usually up at 3 a.m., heading to the Koyambedu market for buying fresh flowers. After selling the flowers, I am already setting up kolam powders by noon,” says Devi, expertly scooping powder into smaller boxes from the sack.

She is adept at putting up these different small stalls one after the other with the changing seasons. This has not only helped to build a loyal customer base but has also funded her children’s education.

“My daughters and son are in good schools and colleges because of my working day and night,” she says.

Her daughter, R. Sangeetha, who graduated recently with a degree in economics, pitches in while job-hunting. “My mother has been at this very spot for decades, like my grandmother. But my family wishes a big career for me,” she says.

On the same street, Surekha S. from Pattinapakkam is equally busy, juggling flower garlands and rangoli powders, along with her mother. “Not only the classic reds and blues that are flying off the shelves, grey and not so primary colours are also becoming popular,” she says.

Rain, a spoiler
Surekha admits that rain sometimes impacts their stock, making the colours hard to come on those days. “This is the season we usually look out for, and from these sales, we save up for leaner months,” she says. Despite selling rangoli powders every year, Surekha chuckles that she is only a beginner, learning to join the dots of kolam through YouTube. “Kolam and rangoli are not just decoration. They are an art form and not as easy as they look,” she says.","Every Margazhi season, South Mada Street in Mylapore comes alive with vibrant kolam and rangoli powders. Ammu R., a fruit shop owner, eagerly awaits this time as her stall gets a colorful makeover, with rangoli powders in high demand. She sells each box for ₹20, with customers purchasing in bulk.

The demand for kolam colors remains steady, attracting not just locals but also international visitors curious about the tradition. Along the Mada Streets, families like R. Devi’s have built a livelihood around selling seasonal items. Devi, who wakes at 3 a.m. to buy flowers at Koyambedu market, shifts to kolam powder sales in December. Her dedication has funded her children's education, including her daughter Sangeetha, an economics graduate.

Similarly, Surekha S. from Pattinapakkam manages both flower garlands and rangoli powders with her mother. She notes that while traditional reds and blues remain popular, unconventional colors are gaining interest. However, rain sometimes affects sales by hardening the powders.

Despite being a seller, Surekha is still learning the intricate art of kolam through YouTube, acknowledging its cultural significance. The kolam season sustains many families financially, making it a vital part of Chennai’s festive traditions.",Local News,192,510

The Telegraph,2024-12-27 00:00:00,"As Hollywood struggles, the region’s economy feels the pain","Film production has failed to bounce back after major strikes last year, and competition from other locales has gotten stiffer.
The struggles have become a painful, recurring storyline in Hollywood.

The economic outlook of the Los Angeles area, with a population larger than most states, has been clouded in recent years by events that have upended the entertainment industry. Market saturation led to a shakeout among direct-to-streaming providers. Then the COVID-19 pandemic shut down production. And strikes by writers and actors last year went on for months, giving studios time to explore filming elsewhere, in regions that offer hefty tax incentives.
When the strikes ended, workers in Hollywood hoped their schedules would finally fill up again. But for many people, things only got worse.
In the third quarter of 2024, film production levels declined 5% from the same stretch in 2023, based on a report from FilmLA, the official film office of the City and County of Los Angeles.
Paul Audley, the organization’s president, said in the report that even a few months ago, many had thought they would see gains — hoping for a rebound from what he called “the strike effect.”
“Instead, we saw a pullback and loss of forward momentum heading into the fall season that will make or break the year,” Audley said.
Since May 2023, when the Writers Guild of America strike began, motion picture and sound recording jobs in the Los Angeles area have declined 15%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
For Deborah Huss Humphries, the past few months have been particularly challenging.
A makeup artist who built a career working on movie and commercial sets around Los Angeles, Huss Humphries remembers when she had to turn down gigs because of a packed schedule. But she has watched the industry evolve over three decades, with productions initially leaving the city, then the state, and even going overseas.
Through lean years, she found a way to make ends meet. Now that has become difficult, she said, and over the past three years, she has started dipping into her savings to cover her monthly expenses.
“What I’ve kept telling myself is, ‘OK, there has to be some relief on the way,’” she said.
These days, she’s not so sure.
Patrick Adler, co-founder of Westwood Economics and Planning Associates, a firm that has studied trends in Hollywood, said he saw the strikes as an inflection point.
He noted that strike settlements usually made productions more expensive. And the work stoppages, Adler said, prompted studio executives to reevaluate their costs and test filming in other locations, such as New Mexico and Georgia.
“Cost of living has grown in LA relative to other possible destinations, leading to ever-larger cost differentials between LA and other possible locations,” said Adler, an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong.
A recent report from Westwood and the Otis College of Art and Design found that in 2013, the film and TV industries made up 64% of Los Angeles County’s broader entertainment industry. That portion has fallen to 52%. (The entertainment fields that are gaining employment, the report found, include video gamers and spectator sports.)
In October, to blunt this movement, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles announced a proposal to more than double the state’s film tax incentive program to $750 million annually. The plan, if approved by state lawmakers, could take effect in July.
In an emailed statement, Bass said, “The entertainment industry is the cornerstone of our city, and we will continue to do everything we can to support the many Angelenos that make it go.”
Over the summer, Bass established a council of entertainment industry leaders to work on finding ways to keep more productions local and signed a directive focused on, among other things, streamlining the permit processes necessary to film in the city. In the directive, she noted data from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. showing that the entertainment industry contributes more than $115 billion annually to the regional economy, accounting for 681,000 jobs.
Some of those jobs come from a wider ecosystem of workers — caterers, dry cleaners and florists, to name a few. Those jobs rely heavily on filming in Los Angeles, many local officials say.
But other places are working hard to lure productions away.
Georgia has an uncapped tax incentive program that has given billions of dollars to Hollywood studios. Officials from New Mexico have successfully enticed executives with tax incentives as well as reminders of the state’s natural beauty and proximity to California.
Netflix, for example, has invested $575 million in productions in New Mexico since 2019, including scenes of “Stranger Things.” And last summer, the company unveiled a significant expansion of its Albuquerque studios that includes, among other projects, four new soundstages.
At least 38 states offer some form of tax incentive, according to a survey by The New York Times.","Hollywood's economic struggles persist, exacerbated by the aftermath of last year’s strikes, the pandemic, and rising competition from states like Georgia and New Mexico offering lucrative tax incentives. Film production in Los Angeles dropped 5% in Q3 2024 compared to 2023, with entertainment jobs in the area declining by 15% since May 2023, according to FilmLA and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Industry veterans, such as makeup artist Deborah Huss Humphries, face financial hardships, relying on savings as work dries up. Patrick Adler of Westwood Economics highlighted that strikes have made productions costlier, pushing studios to explore cheaper filming locations.
In response, California leaders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, proposed doubling the state’s film tax incentives to $750 million annually and streamlining local filming permits to retain productions. Despite these efforts, the share of LA County’s entertainment jobs in film and TV has dropped from 64% in 2013 to 52%.
Meanwhile, states like Georgia and New Mexico attract productions with uncapped tax incentives and proximity to California, with Netflix alone investing $575 million in New Mexico since 2019. At least 38 states now offer film tax incentives, intensifying competition for Hollywood’s business.",Entertainment,197,849

For a game that was as evenly matched as possible, one moment of defensive error led to a
penalty stroke for SRBT, proving to be the difference between the two sides.
For the remaining part, there was little to choose from between the two, matched in their
attempts at goal, circle entries and even scoring their respective opening goals within 30
seconds of each other.
It was a tactical game that saw both outfits play strategically, resulting in most of the work
being done between the two 23-yard lines. For SRBT, Sukhjeet Singh and Abhishek were the
key men with repeated incursions into the circle and Affan Yousuf backing them up, only
to find their shots blocked by goalkeeper Oliver Payne.
SRBT did earn enough penalty corners, however, it had to wait till the sixth one for
Rupinder Pal Singh to finally step into the action — Jugraj Singh was entrusted with the
responsibility till then but was unable to beat Payne — and the veteran made no qualms in
smashing into the net past Payne’s shoulders for the opening goal.
For Gonasika, it was Manpreet Singh, along with Frenchman Victor Charlet, who was the
beating heart, controlling every aspect and running relentlessly to attack, create and
defend.
It was no surprise that the former India captain got his name on the scoresheet as well, 30
seconds after SRBT took lead, swinging to smash into the board, unmarked on the left after
being put through by Struan Walker.
That should have opened up the game but the teams went back to possession play and it
looked like yet another HIL match would go into shootouts. However, a 48th minute
blunder saw SRBT rewarded with the stroke that Rupinder calmly converted.
Gonasika, faced with the prospect of another loss, finally stepped up the temmpo and tried
to find an equaliser but the rushing inside the circle saw the side falter at the finish with
wayward shots, eventually ending on the losing side.
The result: SRBT 2 (Rupinder Pal Singh 31, 48) bt Team Gonasika 1 (Manpreet Singh 32)","**Shrachi Rarh Bengal Tigers (SRBT)** clinched their second straight win of the season with a **2-1 victory over Team Gonasika** on January 1, 2025, at the Birsa Munda Stadium.

The Telegraph,2024-07-19 00:00:00,"Tatler to NYT, WaPo to WSJ, global media gawp as the Ambanis keep up with the Kardashians","Why were Mukesh Ambani and family determined to go on such a flashy spending spree that was certain to attract a blaze of attention both in India and around the world, and definitely not all of it approving?
Was the revealingly clad Kim Kardashian the star guest at the Ambani wedding that has just ended in a blaze of sparkling festivities? Certainly, she got pride of place, making a dramatic entrance in a figure-hugging dress alongside Nita Ambani, the lady described by her new daughter-in-law as the CEO of the evening.

It definitely wasn’t an accidental entrance together by any stretch of imagination. Kardashian has 362 million Instagram followers and Nita will be in every picture with her that’s flashed around the world.
If anyone has any doubts about the Kardashians and their pulling power, consider President Barack Obama who once joked at the White House correspondents’ dinner that he had met Kendall Jenner, another Kardashian. “We had a chance to meet her backstage and she seems like a very nice young woman. I'm not exactly sure what she does but I am told that my Twitter mentions are about to go through the roof."" The excitement’s easing down slowly about the mega-splashy wedding described in the usually starchy French publication Le Monde as “one of the most lavish weddings in history.”
But a giant question mark still hangs over the mega-celebrations that stretched for over five months.Why were Mukesh Ambani and family determined to go on such a flashy spending spree that was certain to attract a blaze of attention both in India and around the world, and definitely not all of it approving?
The Wall Street Journal puts its accounting sleuths to work and reckoned that the entire five-months of extraordinary partying and cruising must have come with a price tag of around $600 million. That, though, is reckoned to be just 0.5 per cent of Mukesh Ambani’s net worth so it’s a sum that's piffling chicken-feed for the family.

Is it that the Ambani wealth has now risen to unimaginable levels and they are determined to display all the glittering jewels they’ve been accumulating over the last decades?

The Ambanis with their string of blowout nuptial bashes made the Crazy Rich Asians look like skinflints by comparison.

They also eclipsed many maharajas of yore -- like the one who famously splashed out and sent every last petal in the Dorchester Hotel flower shop to a woman with whom he had become infatuated. Before Independence, the maharajas were the most-sought after customers at gilded showrooms of jewellery merchants like Cartier and luxury automakers like Rolls-Royce.

Are the Ambanis and other Indian corporate czars now the new heirs to the maharajas? The Ambani wedding felt “like a new level of rich-people watching” with displays of luxury so extraordinary “they have become to seem like self-parody,” the Toronto Star remarked.

Certainly the world sat up and took notice – and when we say the world, we mean just about every corner of this planet.

“The crazy richest wedding ever,” declared NBC, the US TV news channel, adding a gushy string of adjectives like “opulent and ostentatious” and, “that’s just astronomical.”

“Emeralds almost the size of popsicles, ropes of the rarest natural pearls,” marvelled The New York Times which had its eyes firmly fixed on the fist-sized stones on display. The NYT did more than 10 stories on the long-drawn out celebrations over the last five months, covering everything from the jewellery to the Ambani stylists.

The wedding, said The NYT, ""signaled the arrival of the unapologetic Indian billionaire on the global stage — and introduced the world to the country’s Gilded Age.” Even Jay Gatsby, the F. Scott Fizgerald protaganist synonymous with champagne fountains and never-ending parties, “would have been awed,” said the newspaper.

Other publications like The Times, London and The Washington Post also offered breathless coverage. The Australian Financial Review said the nuptials reflected “the rise and rise of crazy rich Indians.”

Only a few stopped to ask the purpose of the global-scale jamboree. Was it just a gigantic public relations exercise that resulted in Reliance publicity, raised India's global profile and was therefore well worth the money spent? Or was the Ambani family just showing off the scale of their wealth. And is such showing off vulgar when you only have to look down the road for a glimpse of Indian poverty?

Unquestionably, the Ambani wedding has been the greatest show on earth ever since the splendidly lavish pre-marriage ceremonies in March. The shower of publicity has turned billionaire Mukesh Ambani into a globally famous name.Yes, he is worth a staggering $122 billion and is the world’s 11th richest man according to the Forbes Real-Time Billionaires List. But he wasn’t a familiar face worldwide like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg.

The gigantic wedding and pre-wedding celebrations have altered all that beyond recognition. The New York Times, Le Monde and the business-focused Wall Street Journal, at one end of the scale, were reporting every high-wire move of the Ambani circus.

At another level, society publications like Vogue, Tatler and even the UK horsey set’s Town & Country magazine were breathlessly ooohing and aaahhhing about everything from the unbelievable jewellery on display to the dazzling larger-than-life wedding sets amidst which the pre-wedding and wedding celebrations took place.

Even in the midst of a brutal war, Israel’s Haaretz devoted space to the mega-wedding celebrations in Mumbai. In Asia, the South China Morning Post reported that, “Extravagant parties are the Ambanis’s speciality” drawing “celebrities, billionaires and world leaders.”

The Greatest Indian Wedding ever also made it to the pages of less well-known publications like the Vietnam Express which reported that: “Ambani heir celebrates $600 million wedding, eclipsing several royal families’ nuptials.”

Reliance Foundation Chairperson Nita Ambani speaks during the second day of her son Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding reception ‘Mangal Utsav’, organised for the Reliance employees and media, in Mumbai. Other members of the Ambani and Merchant families are also seen.

Le Monde couldn’t steer clear of the name-dropping game and reported how Justin Bieber would be singing “in front of Tony Blair, Boris Johnson, the Kardashians, Lana Del Rey, David Beckham, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, the presidents of Aramco and Samsung and many others.”

But Le Monde added sternly that, “The pomp of CEOs has replaced that of kings, and in India today, the upper caste are those who are the friends of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”

Inevitably, the global press corps divided much of its awestruck attention between people-watching and jewellery gazing. Almost running out of superlatives, Vogue magazine declared, “they pulled a collection of jewels from the family vault that bordered on the unfathomable.”

From mother of the groom Nita Ambani’s ""100-carat yellow diamonds to Radhika’s emerald-laden looks, the gems on show were unlike anything seen before,” the bible of style enthused.

Vogue also turned its admiring gaze on Anant and his 720-carat emerald brooch with its “panther perched on a hulking stone.” Anant, said Vogue, “accessorized with more emeralds on his coat’s buttons, a swag of emeralds and pearls on his necklace, and a diamond aigrette brooch on his turban headpiece.”

Town & Country’s Editor Stellene Volandes, too, dived into detail about the precious stones being displayed by the Ambanis and particularly the emeralds that appeared on almost every outfit. “There was jewelry as far as the eye could see, but one stone clearly dominated,” she said, quoting one expert to explain that in India, historically, emeralds have been associated with royalty and divinity, believed to bring wisdom, prosperity, and protection.

Vogue clearly scooped all the other global media with a ringside seat at the actual wedding and a highly sought-after interview with Radhika, the ever-smiling bride, who revealed that Mukesh’s wife Nita Ambani was the moving force behind the mega-events. Said Radhika: “My mother-in-law was the C.E.O. of the wedding, as I like to say. It was Nita’s commitment and vision that brought our entire celebration to life.”

Then, there were the potshots at the Ambanis – plenty of them. About the Mediterranean cruise, UK society magazine Tatler had this to say: “And where do you host over 1,000 of your nearest and dearest? The £900 million cruise liner Celebrity Ascent, of course, which the couple rented out exclusively as they sailed between Palermo and Portofino.”

Tatler was indirectly hinting at a crucial question: how many of the celebrity guests did the Ambanis know at all?

There was one other unanswered question. Why did the Ambanis splurge in such a gigantic way on Anant's wedding celebrations when they had done much less for their other two children?

Inevitably, many writers commented on India's deep poverty which co-exists along with the Ambani display of wealth.

In The New York Times, author Sonia Faleiro commented, “the Ambani-Merchant matrimonial extravaganza shows us where true power in India now lies: with a handful of people whose untrammeled wealth and influence have elevated them to the position of India’s shadow leaders.”

Adding a further critical note, Washington Post’s Gerry Shih, one of the smartest foreign correspondents based in India, noted post-torrential rain had submerged many parts of Mumbai due to decrepit drainage and the Ambani wedding had brought life to a halt in other areas like the Bandra Kurla business district. Shih tartly observed that the amount spent on the wedding would eclipse the yearly education budget of several small Indian states.

While Shih said some Indians saw the wedding as “an awe-inspiring showcase for India’s growing affluence and its rising clout,” other Indians called it “an indictment of its lopsided development.” Time magazine called the opulence of the festivities “jarring” for some in a country with soaring income inequality.

Was it all a gargantuan publicity run-up for a digital Reliance Jio that might take place in the not-so-distant future? Or is Ambani planning to take his digital properties international. These were questions some Indians were asking. But while there were gripes about the colossal expenditure, for the most part the world press was agog at the hedonistic spectacle of rich Indians partying at the mother of all weddings.
","Mukesh Ambani’s family hosted a lavish wedding for Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, drawing global attention for its opulence. The celebrations, stretching over five months and costing around $600 million, were described as one of the most extravagant in history. The events featured celebrities like Kim Kardashian, emphasizing the Ambanis' wealth and influence. The lavish display, compared to historical maharajas, led to mixed reactions, with some viewing it as a celebration of India’s affluence and others criticizing it amidst the country's poverty. The New York Times and other major publications extensively covered the event, highlighting the luxurious jewels and grand festivities. Critics noted the juxtaposition of such wealth against India’s economic disparities and questioned the motivations behind the grand display, suggesting it could be a publicity move for Reliance’s future ventures.

“On May 29, we protested at the Collector’s office asking them to stop imposing the daily fine of Rs 50. But even a month on, the government has still done nothing. To top that, the state government is in talks about permitting bike taxis in Maharashtra, which will make it harder for rickshaw drivers to find work,” informed Nitin Pawar, general secretary of the Rickshaw Panchayat.

“Government decisions, such as Rs 50 fines for delays in fitness certificates and the permission granted to bike taxis, are part of a bigger strategy to exploit the common man,’ said Dr Baba Adhav, president of the state rickshaw organisation action committee and the rickshaw and tempo panchayat. He also condemned the government for using fines for traffic rule violations as a revenue tool instead of creating discipline, pleading with citizens to unite against such unjust decisions.” If the state government takes no action on these issues, we will carry out a large demand march with rickshaws and tempos on August 14,” he warned.

Rickshaw driver Siddarth Chavan, 62, said, “I can’t afford a daily fine of Rs 50. I have a family to feed and children’s education to pay for. We don’t earn much these days due to the growth of online platforms. I hope the government reduces this fine.”


Bharat Uttekar, 59, also said, “I used to earn about Rs 1,200 a day before the widespread use of Ola and Uber rides. Now I get around 600 a day, and so I can’t afford a daily fine of Rs 50 which adds up to Rs 1,500 a month.”

The demands

A memorandum of demands was handed over to assistant regional transport officers Amar Desai and Yuvraj Patil, asking the government to stall the policy permitting bike taxis, suspend the daily fine for fitness certificate delays, and also extend the time frame for obtaining fitness certificates, change the Rickshaw Welfare Board’s decisions to make it more independent, stop the granting of open permits and open rickshaw badges, prohibit the freight transportation portal app, which has an impact on the livelihood of small- and medium-tempo drivers, and renew the fine of twenty thousand rupees for long-distance transport and reimpose the earlier fine of Rs 50.","Autorickshaw drivers in Pune and Pimpri Chinchwad protested at the RTO against a ₹50 daily fine for delayed fitness certificates and the proposed introduction of bike taxis. Organized by Rickshaw Panchayat, the protest had minimal disruption. Drivers argue the fines burden their reduced income due to competition from online platforms. They submitted demands to officials, including suspending the fine, halting bike taxi policies, revising rickshaw welfare decisions, and regulating freight apps. A larger protest is planned for August 14 if no action is taken. Many drivers shared financial struggles, urging the government to reconsider policies affecting their livelihood.

The Hans India,2024-12-28 00:00:00,Inclusion in Play Schools: How SPROUT Supports Different Learning Needs,"The Importance of Inclusion in Play Schools Inclusive settings play a crucial role in the holistic growth and well-being of children. Inclusive learning environments not only enable them to form friendships with their peers but also cultivate higher levels of positive self-perception and self-confidence, which are important for the emotional wellness of students. When a child feels accepted and understood by not only educators but also peers, it paves the way for better performance in all growth areas, including academics. At the same time, the role of inclusion in fostering physical access to learning spaces and in making learning materials accessible cannot be sidelined. Accessibility (the structural side) and inclusion (the social side) are two sides of the same coin, and both are vital in supporting the different learning needs of students. Inclusion Through Learning Styles As studies show, there are mainly four kinds of learning styles. While some children learn through seeing (visual), some learn through hearing (auditory), some learn through touch (tactile), some learn through doing and moving (kinaesthetic), and the list goes on. To be more precise, visual learners tend to benefit from picture books, flashcards, concept cards, and colour-coded materials in the teaching-learning process; auditory learners tend to benefit from rhymes, songs, audio recordings, storytelling, and discussions; tactile learners tend to benefit from craft projects, clay, fabric, sensory bins, and sandpaper letters; and kinaesthetic learners tend to benefit from physical activities such as role-playing and field trips. All this is an important aspect of inclusion in play schools, necessitating the need to align with learning styles through the play school curriculum. Inclusion Through Multiple Intelligences A key part of any high-quality preschool curriculum and early childhood education is inclusion through multiple intelligences. While children have skills in some areas, patience and perseverance can help them develop skills in other areas, given that the learning environment is stimulating and inclusive enough. Inclusion in play schools thus hinges on shifting the traditional focus upon linguistic-verbal and logical-mathematical abilities of students to focusing on a broader range of abilities, such as interpersonal intelligence, intrapersonal intelligence, bodily-kinaesthetic intelligence, and visual-spatial intelligence. Inclusion in play schools through multiple intelligences helps ensure that children not only develop their strengths in areas where they are naturally talented but they also feel motivated and valued enough to excel in areas where they may not be naturally talented. The preschool curriculum has a major part to play in this regard. How SPROUT Supports Different Learning Needs The significance of a well-researched play school curriculum is immense when it comes to accommodating the learning styles and needs of students. Also, SPROUT focuses on the continuous training and professional development of teachers to support different learning needs. It also leverages top-notch tech-learning tools such as Speaking Books and Speaking Pens, Smart Classes, and Robotics to stimulate young minds. Moreover, SPROUT ensures parental involvement through DIY activities, which connect classroom learning with home learning. Towards an Inclusive Future Play schools, with their carefully designed curricula, play a crucial role in shaping the foundational growth of a nation’s younger generations, making inclusivity within these early learning spaces a vital priority. Though there is much work ahead in this direction, transformative steps have been taken in recent years towards creating an inclusive present and future, one of which is Bachpan’s SPROUT Curriculum, notably.","Inclusion in play schools is essential for the holistic development of children, fostering emotional well-being, self-confidence, and academic growth. Inclusive environments help children form friendships and feel understood, while both physical accessibility and social inclusion play critical roles in supporting diverse learning needs. Tailoring education to different learning styles—visual, auditory, tactile, and kinaesthetic—ensures that all students benefit from appropriate teaching methods. Additionally, the theory of multiple intelligences encourages schools to focus on a broader range of abilities beyond traditional skills like linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligence, promoting personal growth in areas like interpersonal and bodily-kinaesthetic intelligence.

The SPROUT Curriculum exemplifies this approach by offering a well-researched curriculum that accommodates various learning styles. It also incorporates modern educational tools like Speaking Books, Smart Classes, and Robotics, while providing continuous teacher training. Parental involvement through DIY activities bridges classroom and home learning, further fostering inclusivity. With initiatives like SPROUT, play schools are making significant strides toward an inclusive future for early childhood education.",Education,160,553

Union Minister for Minority Affairs Kiren Rijiju attended the event to present the sacred offering on behalf of the Prime Minister.

At the dargah, Rijiju prayed for peace and harmony in the country. Following the offering, Prime Minister Modi’s message was read out, calling on people of all religions to work together in unity.

In his message, the Prime Minister extended heartfelt greetings to followers of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti worldwide and to the devotees gathered at Ajmer Sharif. He praised the saint’s contributions to humanity, stressing the enduring relevance of his teachings.

“Saints, pirs, faqirs, and great men have illuminated lives with their welfare ideas. Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti’s messages of public welfare and humanity have left an indelible mark. His life and ideals, dedicated to promoting love and harmony in society, will continue to inspire generations,” the Prime Minister wrote.

He further said, “Every sect and every religion should come together and work for the country and for world peace.”

The Prime Minister expressed hope that the Urs celebrations would strengthen mutual bonds among people and inspire efforts for the betterment of society and the nation. Concluding his message, Modi prayed for the happiness and prosperity of the people and bowed to Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti.

As part of the occasion, the Minister also launched a web portal of the dargah, the ‘Garib Nawaz’ app for pilgrims, and an operations manual for the conduct of the annual ‘Urs’. The Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti is also known as Garib Nawaz or the Protector of the Poor.

However, the offering of the chaadar has sparked fresh controversy. Hindu Sena’s national president, Vishnu Gupta, has filed a petition in the Ajmer Civil Court, seeking to prevent Prime Minister Modi from presenting the chaadar. Gupta argued that the act could influence an ongoing legal case concerning the site of the dargah.

Imphal Free Press,2024-09-06 00:00:00,Giant Asian hornet species increasing in less forest-fire region in Manipur,"The giant Asian hornet and other wasp insects which saw a sharp decline in the last decades due to massive destruction of the forest by wildfire and other man-made activities are steadily showing signs of improvements. This has come about with local authorities and community CSOs strongly advocating awareness of the grassroots and town dwellers on the negative impact of wildfire on forest resources.

Feeling the heat of massive destruction caused to wild species, trees, water sources and people’s livelihood, the concerned state government, the Directorate of Climate Change and Environment, Government of Manipur, in particular, has initiated a series of awareness programmes to educate the masses about the impending doom facing the people of the region.


It is worth mentioning that the hills of Manipur in India’s north eastern region are home to myriads of wasps and bee species in addition to scores of flora and fauna. However, the sad reality is that widespread destruction of the forest has made them endangered species, with wasps and bee families being one of the most affected.


As natural as playing a guitar comes to the people of Manipur’s Ukhrul community, when it comes to apiculture (bee rearing) and wasps including Api Dorsata, Api Indica and Apis Melifera, among others for their larvae, they have been blessed with pool of skills on it.


The so-called larvae of the nutritious wild giant hornet, which is locally called “Khuirei” in Tangkhul, is in high demand in the north eastern region given its exceptionally sumptuous taste, size and the aroma it produces.


A single piece of giant hornet larvae comes to Rs 20-25 in Ukhrul and Kamjong districts. Given its skyrocketing price tag, it has become a richman’s dish.


40-year-old Mason SK is a giant hornet rearer in the remote north of Manipur’s Ukhrul district. He has been into this venture since his childhood days and still continues to rear when the season approaches.


In the life of grassroot people where employment opportunities are very scarce, wasps rearing makes life somehow better than others for Mason, in terms of income. He is one such parent who supports his family through wasps rearing and paddy plantation.

Armed with self-taught art in wasps rearing, he is also a good tree climber, which again comes very handy in catching smaller wasps which make its nest in the tree, especially tall ones. It requires skills, strength and courage as it is mostly done using indigenous style blend with a bit of modern technique.


A good giant hornet, when it is ripe for harvest, yields not less than 8 nests (hives) containing not less than 30 to 40 kilos of larvae.


To rear a wasp, although there is no hard and fast rule, a hole measuring about four and half feet deep and four to five feet in length and breadth is dug to rear the giant hornet. Upon finding its feeding trees, a day or two is spent, in some cases four days, to be tracked down to its nest/home. Post working out all these details, a hole is dug and the hornet king along with its armies of wasp and nest is carefully extracted from their home/hole and placed in their new home.


To make the wasps nest big or to let it have more nests purely depends on the rearer. To make its size bigger, either a solid hard rock has to be placed or cemented. On the other hand, to have more nests the hole beneath where it is hanged has to be let loose. It’s purely the rearer’s choice, though.


Sharing exclusively to the Imphal Free Press, Mason said the giant Asian hornet population is reportedly on the rise in rural villages where local authorities had imposed a blanket ban on forest fire with heavy penalties on the defaulters. “I have been in the business of wasp keeping for the last two decades generating not less than Rs 80,000 annually. As a young boy I didn’t earn that much but as I grew older and backed with experience, my annual income improved.”


This year, I have reared only four giant hornets though I could rear not less than 7 to 8. Moreover, as a cultivator I could not spare enough time to search for it. Increase in wasp and bee species is a ray of hope for farmers like me as earnings from it comes as a big relief in dealing with financial difficulties, he added before signing off for visiting his field.


A bottle of pure honeybee is sold at Rs 1,000 per one litre bottle in the local market.


Ason L, 65, who is an avid giant hornet larvae consumer, testified that among all the wasps larvae, hornet is the best, given its taste and size. In our days, it was quite affordable even for a poor farmer like myself. However, its prices have drastically changed today and it is beyond my capacity to buy, he lamented, while recalling the good old bygone days.


Commenting on wasps and beekeeping benefits, Dr. Arati Ningombam, senior Entomology scientist at ICARNER Manipur Centre said as long as Ukhrul is rearing hornet and honeybee for eating, its grubs or young ones there cannot be commercial wasp or beekeeping in Ukhrul.
Beekeeping comes under secondary agriculture. Funding is provided through Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) and beekeeping activities are encouraged under National Beekeeping and Honey Mission (NBHM) under National Bee Board.


No doubt, grubs of hornets and other wasps come under edible insects and are very nutritious with high protein and essential amino acids content.


Moreover, it helps in pollinating flowers just like any insect which pollinates flowers; it’s a general ecosystem service.


In notable movements towards preserving the endangered “Khuirei”, Leishi village under Kamjong district has started observing “Khui Phanit” (wasp festival) since 2022.


As per reports collected from several wasp rearers it is reported that in areas where effective forest conservation compliance were followed, with special focus on burning of wildfire, there is sharp rise in wasps and bee species while in less effective regions its population shows a downward trend.


Rungshing Angkang, headman Leishi village, said that with the aim to preserve the fast diminishing forest cover and to preserve its rich flora and fauna and water sources, the village had totally banned wildfire, hunting and use of chemicals and electrical appliances for fishing. “Preserving forest should be the bounden responsibility of every stakeholder and not just village authority because we breathe the same air and no amount of money can replace it,” the headman said.


Preserving  bees, wasps and other wild species are some of the major activities initiated by the village.
He continued that in their bid to conserve forest, the village authority (VA), in coordination with its affiliating bodies, have taken up a series of environment friendly initiatives. “Tree plantation, banning of hunting, wildfire and use of chemicals and electrical appliances for fishing are some of the major measures the village had initiated, among others, “ he added.


Wasps larvae are a seasonal flavour, although one could preserve it yearlong using preservatives. Normally, Asian hornet rearing starts in the last week of March and matures in the 2nd week of October and in some cases, November. A single giant hornet with good yields fetches not less than Rs 35,000-40,000 in the market.


Taking a cue from these developments, when the IFP contacted the Horticulture officer of Ukhrul to find out the benefits available for the wasps rearers, they couldn’t be reached.
","Manipur is witnessing a steady resurgence in the population of giant Asian hornets and other wasps, thanks to community-driven conservation efforts aimed at combating forest destruction caused by wildfires. Local authorities, alongside civil society organizations (CSOs), have increased awareness on the adverse effects of wildfires on forest ecosystems, wildlife, and local livelihoods.

Mason SK, a wasp rearer from Manipur’s Ukhrul district, shared his experience in rearing giant hornets, which provides him with a significant annual income. Wasp larvae, locally called ""Khuirei,"" are highly prized in the region for their taste and nutritional value, with a single hornet larvae selling for Rs 20-25 in the local market.

Dr. Arati Ningombam, a senior entomologist, emphasized the ecological importance of wasps and bees, noting their role in pollination. Efforts to preserve these species, such as the “Khui Phanit” (Wasp Festival) in Leishi village, have been bolstered by community initiatives to ban wildfires, hunting, and chemical-based fishing methods. These conservation measures have led to a significant rise in wasp and bee populations in areas where forest conservation is effectively enforced.",Environment,176,1251

Indian Express,2024-12-12 00:00:00,"Will AAP, won’t AAP? A cancelled event of Rahul Gandhi and a familiar Congress story in Delhi","The connection between the two developments, sources said, is the lingering hope and belief of the Congress senior leadership that the two parties will ultimately come together before the polls. While both the AAP as well as the Congress’s Delhi unit have publicly denied any possibility of collaboration, Congress sources said that what has kept this hope and belief alive is that behind-the-scenes, negotiations are still taking place.

Publicly, on Tuesday, if Kejriwal put out on X that “Aam Aadmi Party will be fighting this election on its own strength in Delhi. There is no possibility of any alliance with Congress”, Delhi Congress chief Devender Yadav told reporters: “We will contest the Assembly elections alone and we are in a very strong position to come back to power. We will not have any tie-up with the corrupt Kejriwal party; we have already paid a heavy price for aligning with the AAP during the Lok Sabha polls.”

Gandhi staying away from Wednesday’s event only underlines this gap between the Congress’s central leadership and state unit on the issue. No senior leadership turned up for the entire duration of the Dilli Nyay Yatra, which ended on December 7, either, though the Congress had earlier announced that Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge and the party chief ministers would be joining the march – modelled after Rahul Gandhi’s successful Bharat Jodo Yatra.

Sources said the Congress leadership did not want to risk antagonising a mercurial Kejriwal by participating in a yatra that was designed precisely to target the AAP government in Delhi.

On the cancellation of Wednesday’s event, a source in the All India Congress Committee (AICC) said, “The yatra was targeting the AAP on a daily basis. In such a situation, the senior leadership’s attendance would have sent the wrong message and led to issues if an alliance was to take place.”

Congress insiders, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said discussions with the AAP were still underway. “Multiple rounds of meetings have taken place. The only hurdle is that the two parties are not able to come to an agreement on the number of seats to share. It will take time to reach a consensus,” a senior Delhi Congress leader said.

The AAP and Congress have fought elections on a seat-sharing pact once earlier – during the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, with the AAP contesting four seats and the Congress three in Delhi, and not meeting any success. After the polls, both the parties had pointed fingers towards each other and cited coordination issues.

For many, the differences between the two parties are too sharp to be easily overlooked, with the AAP’s rise resting on the Congress’s decline. The party that ruled Delhi for 15 straight years has been struggling in the Capital since the AAP’s rise, demolished by the latter in the Assembly polls and by the BJP in the Lok Sabha elections. It hasn’t had an MP in Delhi now since 2009 and an MLA since 2015.

However, common enemy BJP forced the AAP and Congress together in the Lok Sabha polls, with the two parties also reaching an agreement in Haryana. However, in that state too, the Assembly elections saw the two parties fall apart as the state Congress insisted on going alone.

The AAP, it is believed, could pay back in kind in Delhi. In fact, sources in the party insisted that its decision against an alliance with the Congress was final. On why the issue had become a talking point again, an AAP leader said: “The speculation gained traction Tuesday because of a meeting between NCP leader Sharad Pawar and Kejriwal. The meeting was essentially about the leadership of the INDIA bloc,” an AAP leader said.

But that is not good news for the Congress either as the Maharashtra Assembly poll debacle for the party, on top of its Haryana loss and poor show in Jammu and Kashmir, has triggered rumblings within the INDIA bloc over leadership. While not overtly stated, the Congress as the largest party of the bloc is considered the leader of the group.

Plus, Wednesday’s cancelled event underlines the impression of a Congress flailing in Delhi, even as the AAP and BJP campaigns have picked up steam.

Delhi Congress leaders, however, insisted that things were on track and the first list of candidates would be out within the next 10 days. A Delhi PCC leader claimed the AAP would “come under pressure” after the Congress list. “We will announce names in seats where the AAP has not named its candidates so far.”

The AAP has announced names for 31 seats already, dropping 16 sitting MLAs in the process.

The first Congress list is expected to include names such as Sandeep Dikshit, former MP and the son of Delhi’s longest-serving CM Sheila Dikshit; five-time MLA Haroon Yousuf; Congress Mahila Wing chief Alka Lamba; and PCC chief Devender Yadav. Another name doing the rounds is Mumtaz Patel, the daughter of late Congress Rajya Sabha MP Ahmed Patel.

All of them have been active during the Dilli Nyay Yatra.","Despite public denials from both AAP and Congress, sources suggest behind-the-scenes negotiations are ongoing for a potential alliance in Delhi. While Congress leadership has distanced itself from events targeting AAP, discussions are said to be stalling over seat-sharing arrangements. Both parties, having previously contested elections together, face internal challenges, with the AAP maintaining it will contest alone. Meanwhile, Congress is preparing to announce its candidate list, hoping to exert pressure on the AAP.",Politics,73,846

The New Indian Express,2024-07-18 00:00:00,"AAP to go solo in Haryana, will contest all 90 assembly seats","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday said it will contest all 90 assembly seats in Haryana, where people want ""badlav"" (change) and are looking at it with great hope.

The AAP said it will announce party national convenor Arvind Kejriwal's guarantees on July 20.

The Haryana Assembly elections are due later this year.

Addressing the media here, Sanjay Singh said the AAP will fight the Haryana Assembly polls strongly.

""The AAP will contest all 90 seats,"" said the Rajya Sabha MP, who was flanked by Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann, senior AAP leaders Sandeep Pathak and Anurag Dhanda, and party state unit president Sushil Gupta.

Though the AAP has contested multiple elections in Haryana, it has yet to taste electoral success.

The AAP had contested the recent Lok Sabha elections in alliance with its INDIA bloc partner Congress. While the Congress won five of the nine Lok Sabha seats it contested, the AAP unsuccessfully contested the Kurukshetra seat.

Haryana Congress leaders, including Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Udai Bhan, have hinted that the party might go solo in the assembly polls, with both saying that it is capable of contesting all 90 seats on its own.

Singh targeted the BJP government in Haryana over the issues of unemployment, law and order, and the Agnipath scheme.

""Today, there is an industry of extortion in Haryana. We saw how farmers were crushed during their agitation. Unemployment is also a big problem in Haryana,"" he said.

Terming the Agnipath scheme an ""insult to the Army"", he said, ""Will the Army run on contract?"" The scheme should be rolled back and the AAP will raise this issue ahead of the polls.

The Centre announced the Agnipath scheme in 2022.

It provides for recruiting youths between the age bracket of 17-and-half years and 21 for four years with a provision to retain 25 per cent of them for 15 more years. These recruits are called Agniveers.

","The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has announced its intention to contest all 90 assembly seats in Haryana for the upcoming elections, promising significant change and highlighting issues such as unemployment, law and order, and the controversial Agnipath scheme. The party will unveil its guarantees on July 20. Despite multiple attempts in the past, the AAP has not yet succeeded in Haryana. The Haryana Congress is considering a solo run in the assembly polls.

“Nearly 30 to 40 years ago, or even until 10 to 15 years ago, many persons in Tamil Nadu used to go abroad for medical treatment,” he said. Now, people from abroad are seeking treatment in hospitals in TN for neurological conditions, knee replacements, organ transplants as well as cardiac ailments, he added, while speaking at an event at Kauvery Hospital, Vadapalani where he launched a ‘Cardiac Shock Team’ on Thursday.

Under ‘Idhayam Kappom’ a scheme that was launched in June 2023, emergency loading doses were stocked at 10,000 rural health facilities — 8,713 Health Sub-Centres (HSC) and 2,286 Primary Health Centres (PHC). Persons having mild cardiac symptoms are given loading doses and immediately shifted to a tertiary care centre under the scheme, he said. “So far, 10,474 persons have benefitted by taking the loading doses in PHCs and 613 in HSCs,” the Minister said.

Speaking on management of cardiac shock, S. Thanikachalam, chairman and director, Cardiac Care Centre, Sri Ramachandra Medical Centre, observed that every moment counted while transferring a patient to a tertiary care centre. A mechanism to hold traffic and allow the vehicle to pass is necessary, and there could be set protocols for management. “A modus operandi of how to transfer a patient to a tertiary care centre is important,” he added.

P. Manokar, senior consultant, Interventional Cardiology and Clinical Lead, Heart Failure and Transplant Programme at the Kauvery hospital, said cardiogenic shock has a significantly high mortality. Once a cardiogenic shock alert comes, the Cardiac Shock Team will be activated.

Timely intervention matters in managing cardiogenic shock, he said, adding that the team comprises cardiologist, interventional cardiologist, cardiac surgical team, vascular surgeons, cardiac intensivist, anaesthetist and support staff.

The Telegraph,2024-07-07 00:00:00,Plea in Supreme Court for confiscation of money received by political parties under Electoral Bonds scheme,"A plea has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a direction for the confiscation of the money received by political parties under the electoral bonds scheme of 2018 that was struck down by the apex court in February.

The plea filed by petitioner Khem Singh Bhati said that on February 15, in the case of Association for Democratic Reforms versus Union of India, the apex court struck down electoral bonds scheme as it was violative of Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.

It said this court further directed the State Bank of India (SBI) to stop the issuance of electoral bonds from the date of the judgement and to disclose the details of the bonds purchased since April 12, 2019, till the date of the judgement.

""It is submitted that the amount received by the political parties through electoral bonds was neither 'donation' nor 'voluntary contribution'; rather it was 'barter money' received from various corporate houses by way of 'quid pro quo' for the undue benefits granted at the cost of the public exchequer,"" the plea alleged.

The plea - drawn by senior advocate Vijay Hansaria and filed through advocate Jayesh K Unnikrishnan - claimed the details of the purchase and encashment of the electoral bonds clearly show that money paid through electoral bonds by the companies to the political parties, ""was either to avoid criminal prosecution or to get monetary advantage by way of contract or other policy matters"".

""The political parties have misused their position, being the ruling party in the Government and procured Electoral Bonds behind the iron curtain"".

""The political parties used Electoral Bond as a tool and method to extract money, by conferring undue advantage to corporate houses by way of compromising their criminal prosecution or granting State largesse, at the cost of public exchequer and against public interest,"" it alleged.

The petitioner also sought a direction for constituting a Committee headed by a former judge of the apex court to investigate the alleged ""illegal benefits"" conferred on the donors by public authorities.

The plea in the alternative sought direction to the Income Tax Authorities to reopen to assessment of respondent Nos. 4 to 25 (political parties) from the Financial Year 2018 - 2019 to 2023 - 2024 and disallow the exemptions of income tax claimed by them under section 13A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and levy income tax, interest and penalty on the amount received by way of Electoral Bonds.

On February 15, in a landmark judgement that delivered a big blow to the government, the top court annulled the electoral bonds scheme for political funding, saying it violates the Constitutional right to freedom of speech and expression as well as the right to information.

In its verdict months ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the apex court had ordered the SBI to disclose to the Election Commission the names of the contributors to the six-year-old scheme.","A petition has been filed in the Supreme Court to confiscate money political parties received through electoral bonds. The petitioner argues this money was obtained through ""quid pro quo"" and not legitimate donations. The petition claims political parties misused their power to grant undue benefits to donors in exchange for money.

livemint,2024-09-17 00:00:00,Ventive's IPO announcement was timed perfectly. But not for investors.,"“Strike while the iron is hot,"" the saying goes. Ventive Hospitality’s recent announcement of an initial public offering (IPO) exemplifies this, as it comes amid a boom in the domestic IPO market and an upcycle in the hotel industry. The company plans to raise up to ₹2,000 crore through a fresh issue of shares.

Industry experts and analysts said that as tailwinds in the hotel industry are starting to slow down, Ventive’s promoters have found the perfect opportunity to cash out while the exuberance in the stock market is still high.

A cutback in urban spending and a moderation in occupancy rates at hotels in FY24 are early signs that the upcycle in the hotel industry is reaching its peak, according to analysts. Major listed hotel companies saw only a 1% on-year rise in their average occupancy rate at 75% in FY24, according to Ventive’s draft red herring prospectus. The occupancy rate at the peak of the previous upcycle in FY06-FY07 was around 71-72%, according to Statista.

There's room at the top

However, demand for premium properties still has more room to run. Aspirational spending on lifestyle and experiences by Millennials and Gen Z-ers, the rise of spiritual tourism, and a lucrative domestic wedding industry will continue to generate healthy demand for premium hotels in the near term, analysts said.

An IDBI Capital report noted, “In a boost for the Indian hospitality industry, 2,706 new rooms were added in the upscale and premium segment in the first half of this year… amid a notable growth in infrastructure development. Of these, 994 rooms (37%) were upscale while the remaining (63%) consisted of premium inventories.""

This seems to put Ventive, which operates in the premium segment, in a sweet spot. However, its key performance indicators paint a mixed picture of its prospects. While it boasted a profit margin of 34% for FY24, the highest among its peers, it also had the lowest occupancy rate at 56% during the same period, according to its draft red herring prospectus.

Interestingly, while most of its peers saw marginal on-year growth in occupancy rates in FY24, Ventive’s fell almost 7%. As a result, even though its average room rate was ₹12,690.40, second only to that of India Hotels Company, its revenue grew the slowest at 11% on-year to ₹478 crore in FY24. It reported 27% on-year growth in net profit at ₹166 crore during the same period.

The company, a joint venture between Panchshil group and Blackstone, has 11 luxury properties in India and the Maldives. These are either operated by or franchised from global operators such as Marriott, Hilton, Minor and Atmosphere. The company has three more properties under construction in India and Sri Lanka, according to its draft red herring prospectus.

Has the post-covid boom peaked?

Hotel companies have been building their inventory steadily over the past couple of years to cater to the post-pandemic surge in “revenge"" travel and spending that jump-started the upcycle in the hospitality industry. As occupancy rates in hotels soared amid robust demand over the last couple of years, these companies’ stocks underwent a major re-rating.

Also read: The IPO frenzy isn't a sign of a robust stock market

Stocks of the top listed hotel companies – Indian Hotels Company, EIH, Chalet Hotels, Samhi Hotels and Lemon Tree Hotels – have returned an average of 35% so far in 2024. Only Juniper Hotels and Apeejay Surrendra Park Hotels – which were listed just this February – are down 10% on average over the same period.

According to industry experts, the stocks of these companies have limited room to grow from here on as the industry’s upcycle is nearing its peak. “The industry is not in the early years of its upcycle – it is moving towards the peak. Existing investors have already enjoyed the benefits of the re-rating (of these companies),"" said a fund manager at a large mutual fund house, who did not wish to be named. “Anyone who is planning to make a fresh entry into the industry (through Ventive) must keep this in mind.""

The camp was organised by Commissioner of Police (CP) Dr Ravinder Singal after observing the rising number of complaints related to land transactions. While complaints came from across the city, the majority, 106, were from Zone 4, which pointed that South Nagpur is under the radar of land mafias.
 
Development activities are progressing in Wathoda, Beltarodi, Hudkeshwar, and Nandanvan, and the land mafias and fraudsters are banking on this opportunity and duping gullible investors. During the camp, all five Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) and their subordinate officers were present.

A follow-up review is scheduled in two days. While speaking to The Hitavada, CP Dr Singal said that the high turnout at the camp means the escalating land disputes in the city. Therefore, the City police would ensure citizen voices are to be heard at police stations in land fraud related cases. He also acknowledged the procedural hurdles in filing FIRs for land-related frauds as it required thorough document verification. However, efforts are being made to expedite resolutions, he stated. CP Singal also claimed that action will be taken under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) against land mafias, including builders and property brokers identified through ongoing investigations and criminal records. Complex cases involving multiple instances of fraud are also being investigated. Any involvement of government officials in the land fraud will result in registration of FIRs against them, warned the CP.

In a letter, the EGI highlighted how the fundamental freedom of the press has come under “increasing threat due to several legislative measures passed by the government”. It added that these measures were “taken without adequate stakeholder consultation and parliamentary scrutiny in the drafting and passing of these laws”.

“They carry provisions that are vague and overboard, which could be misused to restrict legitimate journalistic activities,” the EGI further said.

The New Indian Express,2024-08-19 00:00:00,"X announces suspension of Brazil operations, alleging ‘censorship orders’ from Supreme Court justice Company to remove staff but continue service; clash over free speech and censorship intensifies","MEXICO CITY: Social media platform X said Saturday it will close its operations in Brazil, claiming Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes threatened to arrest its legal representative in Brazil if they did not comply with orders.

X is removing all remaining Brazil staff in the country “effective immediately,” though the company said service will still be available to the people of Brazil. The company did not clarify how it could claim to suspend operations while continuing to provide services to Brazilians.

Earlier this year, the company clashed with de Moraes over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation on X. The company said his most recent orders amounted to censorship, and shared a copy of the document on X.

The Supreme Court’s press office didn’t immediately respond to Associated Press email requests seeking comment, or to confirm the veracity of the document, on Saturday.

In the United States, free speech is a constitutional right that’s much more permissive than in many countries, including Brazil, where de Moraes in April ordered an investigation into CEO Elon Musk over the dissemination of defamatory fake news and another probe over possible obstruction, incitement and criminal organization.

Brazil’s political right has long characterized de Moraes as overstepping his bounds to clamp down on free speech and engage in political persecution.

Whether investigating former President Jair Bolsonaro, banishing his far-right allies from social media, or ordering the arrest of supporters who stormed government buildings on Jan. 8, 2023, de Moraes has aggressively pursued those he views as undermining Brazil’s young democracy.

“Moraes has chosen to threaten our staff in Brazil rather than respect the law or due process,” the company said in a statement on X.

In a tweet Saturday morning, the self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” and owner of X, Musk, said de Moraes “is an utter disgrace to justice.”","Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) announced it will cease operations in Brazil following threats from Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to arrest its local legal representative if the company did not comply with court orders.

Mint,2024-07-02 00:00:00,KKR sharpens healthcare focus with Kerala BMH bet,"Private equity giant KKR on Monday scooped up a controlling stake in Kerala-based Baby Memorial Hospital (BMH), doubling down on India’s healthcare sector where it has made a series of investments in the recent past.

Financial details of the acquisition were not revealed; however, a person familiar with the deal said KKR’s KKR’s Asian Fund IV bought 70% stake in BMH for ₹2,000 crore, valuing the multi-specialty hospital chain at ₹2,500 crore.

The investment will help the hospital chain’s pan-India expansion and medical infrastructure, the private equity firm said.

The deal is part of KKR’s effort to increase its exposure to India’s growing healthcare sector after making several investments in the space including healthcare revenue solutions provider Infinx and injectables company Gland Pharma. The US private equity fund’s India portfolio also includes drugmaker JB Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Ltd, health tech firm Infinx, and PHC. Recently, KKR acquired a controlling stake in medical device maker Healthium.

According to the Bain India Private Equity Report 2024, healthcare investments in India hit a record $5.5 billion in 2023, with 20% of the capital raised for healthcare allocated to single-specialty hospitals.

Founded in 1987 by K.G. Alexander, BMH operates 1,000 beds across Kozhikode and Kannur in Kerala, offering a range of services from cardiology to orthopaedic care.

Akshay Tanna, KKR’s head of India private equity, emphasized the firm’s strategic focus on India’s healthcare, aiming to extend BMH’s reach to more patients across the country.

“We are pleased to be strategic partners with Dr K. G. Alexander and family through this investment, which will aid BMH in expanding its network of hospitals and continuing to invest in medical infrastructure so that its medical services can reach more patients in India,” Tanna added.

KKR had sold its Max Healthcare stake in 2022 for around ₹9,400 crore, marking its largest exit from an Indian firm.

KKR has also made investments in the consumer sector in India, with a nearly 1.42% stake in Reliance Retail in September 2023. Other notable India investments include supply chain firm LEAP India and renewable energy firm Serentica.

In November last year, the private equity firm had collected $2.8 billion for its second global impact fund dedicated to advance sustainability and social equity.

KKR’s Kerala hospital deal comes amid a surge of major investments in India’s healthcare sector by leading global funds.

Last year, Blackstone, the world’s largest private equity firm, completed a $1 billion acquisition of Care Hospitals and KIMS Health. Singapore’s state investment firm Temasek secured a controlling stake in Manipal Hospitals, while Swedish buyout firm EQT acquired Indira IVF.

Financial Express,2024-10-09 00:00:00,What happens when microplastics enter your blood? Know all about hidden link to heart and brain disorders,"Microplastics, tiny plastic particles less than five millimeters in size, are ubiquitous in the environment and have infiltrated every part of human lives. From oceans and soils to the food people eat and the water they drink, they have permeated the very core of ecosystem.

Recent research reveals a concerning link between microplastics and human health, especially regarding their impact on the bloodstream, heart disease, and even neurological disorders.The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also recently released a report that found microplastics in common food items, such as sugar and salt. The ongoing Indian project on microplastic contamination in food aims to fill this gap, providing vital insights into the exposure levels in Indian consumers.A groundbreaking study published in Environment International in 2022 found microplastics in human blood for the first time, raising alarm over the potential health risks associated with these particles. The study examined blood samples from 22 anonymous donors and detected microplastics in 17 of them. Most notably, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), commonly found in beverage bottles, and polystyrene (PS), used in food packaging, were prevalent in the samples.

According to Dr. Praveen Gupta, Principal Director & Chief of Neurology, Fortis Hospital, once microplastics enter the bloodstream, they can trigger an immune response, leading to persistent inflammation.“This chronic inflammation has the potential to disrupt normal bodily functions, and over time, is strongly associated with a range of serious health issues, including cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. The long-term impact of microplastic exposure is becoming a critical concern for public health,” Dr. Gupta said.

A 2023 study by researchers from the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands explored the relationship between microplastics and cardiovascular health. They found that microplastics could accumulate in blood vessels, contributing to the formation of plaques, which is a key factor in atherosclerosis—a condition that narrows and hardens arteries.

Ultimately the risks of cardiovascular diseases including heart attacks increases, experts emphasised.

“The presence of foreign particles in the bloodstream may lead to inflammation, oxidative stress, and damage to blood vessels. With increasing exposure to microplastics over a period of time, the damage can be severe, contributing to cardio disorders. Given the rise in cardiovascular diseases globally, understanding the role of environmental factors like microplastics is crucial,” said Dr. Shilpa Gupta, Associate Director – Pathology, Asian Hospital.

In addition to cardiovascular concerns, microplastics have been shown to potentially affect brain health.

“We are finding increasing evidence that neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and even brain strokes are closely linked to environmental pollution and toxicity. Microplastics have now emerged as a significant concern. Once these tiny particles enter our bloodstream, they can cross the blood-brain barrier, compromising the protective shield that safeguards our brain from harmful substances. Studies reveal that that microplastics could contribute to neuroinflammation—an immune response in the brain that has been linked to several neurological disorders. We have evidence that microplastic particles interferes with neurons, leading to inflammation and, over time, accelerating cognitive decline,” added Dr Praveen Gupta.

Moreover, Dr Bhaskar Shukla, Senior Consultant- Neurology, PSRI Hospital said that microplastics pose an underestimated threat to brain health.

“The blood-brain barrier is highly selective, but microplastic particles are small enough to bypass this defense. Over time, the buildup of these particles could contribute to neurodegenerative diseases,” Dr. Shukla said.

India has increasingly recognized the issue of microplastic pollution, and there have been several studies conducted by Indian researchers on the impact of microplastics on health and the environment. A study conducted by Institute of Advanced Study in Science and Technology (IASST), Guwahati in 2020 found microplastic contamination in freshwater bodies in Assam.Given the growing body of evidence linking microplastics to serious health issues, the experts underpinned the need for urgent action. Reducing plastic production and limiting single-use plastics are critical steps in mitigating the prevalence of microplastics. Additionally, regulatory bodies must establish stricter guidelines for the use of plastics in consumer goods and push for the development of safer alternatives.

The experts said that the government has taken some initiatives but more needs to address the challenges pertaining to this public health hazard. The government’s project titled “Micro-and Nano-Plastics as Emerging Food Contaminants” is being carried out in collaboration with institutions like the CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (Lucknow), ICAR-Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (Kochi), and Birla Institute of Technology and Science (Pilani).

The initiative aims to develop validated methodologies for detecting microplastics in various food products and to assess their prevalence and exposure levels in India.

“From heart disease to neuroinflammation, the invisible dangers of microplastics may have far-reaching consequences for public health. The challenge is multifaceted, involving environmental, industrial, and healthcare sectors. We need comprehensive policies that address plastic pollution and emphasize the health risks associated with long-term exposure to microplastics. Only through a coordinated effort can we mitigate the impact on human health,” Dr. Ashish Agarwal, Director- Cardiology, Aakash Healthcare said","Microplastics, tiny particles under 5mm, are found everywhere in the environment and pose serious risks to human health. Recent studies show microplastics can enter the bloodstream, leading to chronic inflammation and health issues such as cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. Research also links microplastics to heart disease, with evidence suggesting they may contribute to plaque formation and neuroinflammation. Experts call for stricter regulations on plastic use and improved detection methods in food products to mitigate these risks.",Health and Wellness,77,811

Amid the health crisis, a person claiming to be her close friend, reportedly with her consent shared that Zhao had been “verbally abused and physically assaulted” by her company boss. The actor’s weight reportedly dropped to 37 kgs.

Following this, the actor’s agency shared a statement on Sina Weibo. It read: “We fully accept feedback and suggestions, and we sincerely reflect on our shortcomings and apologize for them. But, we will not tolerate any baseless and malicious slander, and we sincerely apologize to those friends who have been unjustly harmed.”

Over the past few days, several videos of the actor’s physical condition went viral where she can be seen walking unsteadily and failing to hold a spoon.

Amid all the rumours and speculations, Zhao Lusi herself took to her official Weibo account and shared a long statement about her current situation highlighting she is suffering from depression, was abused as a child and also experienced pneumonia, emphysema, pityriasis rosea, urticaria, night sweats, and neurogenic hearing loss, among others.

Her statement, roughly translated in English, reads: “First and Last Response to Recent Events. Apologies for taking up public resources. Before this, I never let my illness affect my work or those around me. I also admit my own problems. Because I tend to endure, it’s only during this past half month that I’ve realized I’m not as generous and forgiving at heart as I thought. So, I also bear some responsibility.”

Expressing gratefulness for her career and the kind of support it brought to her, the actress further wrote, ” I support anyone’s right to choose their desired career at any time because you always have the right to escape situations that bring suffering and exhaustion. You can stop anytime—you are free, and you can be brave. I also understand that everyone has faced grievances and injustices. I’ve heard far too many horrifying stories. When there is no help, and the abuser continues to escalate, regardless of profession, age, or gender, it is wrong. Forcing someone to reopen their wounds to prove “it’s not overthinking,” “it’s not weak resilience,” or “it’s not dissatisfaction” is absurd. No one but a doctor has the right to determine the severity of someone’s trauma or whether it qualifies as an illness.”

The actress further revealed that she experienced depression in 2019. However, people asked her to not “overthink” or to think “positive”. “I also thought I was being dramatic and sensitive and didn’t take my mental health seriously”, wrote the actress.

Sharing her experience, the actress said, “In 2021, I felt like bugs were crawling on me, like needles were pricking me, accompanied by allergies. After seeing doctors, getting medications, and receiving injections, the symptoms didn’t improve. I sought out a psychologist to help ease my anxiety.”

Zhao’s situation only got worse when in 2023 she experienced pneumonia, emphysema, pityriasis rosea, urticaria, night sweats, neurogenic hearing loss, and the loss of loved ones and cancer diagnoses among family members.

“All these events happened in a short period, overshadowing my emotions, and I continued to neglect my health.”

In 2024, she felt frequent retching, dizziness, joint pain, neck pain, and other obvious physical symptoms along with worsening allergies, which the actress mistook as “side-effects of allergy-targeted medication.”

In the same post, she also spoke about her childhood traumas that added up to her mental health over the years.

“When I was a child, people called me a useless “pretty face.” During extracurricular tutoring, I was beaten in the teacher’s dormitory. At the time, I thought it was right to be punished because I wasn’t good at studying. I didn’t dare speak out because I was taught to “always find the problem within yourself.”

The physical abuse continued in her life when she failed to secure an acting role. “I thought it was my fault, so I didn’t dare make a fuss—I just wanted to escape. I was used to handling my problems alone and didn’t have the habit of seeking help. Later, when my work was recognized, I gained the courage to say goodbye to those who hurt me.”

However, when the actress stood for herself she was demanded a huge “breakup fee” to stop their “manipulative behaviour.”

She said, “Countless defamation attempts inside and outside the industry followed, with people coming to me after gossiping about me. Each time, the pain only deepened. The harm has never stopped.”

At the end, the actress shared the only reason she came out in open about her mental and physical struggles is to make people aware of mental healthy issues which they otherwise don’t take seriously.

“I have never spoken about my illness before because I didn’t want it to turn into so-called “hype.” However, given the current situation, I want to share this so that more people understand: Depression is an emotion, but depression as a condition is a disease. It cannot simply be resolved by “thinking positively” or “talking it out.”

Water, property and cleanliness fee will be imposed in all 222 Panchayats under Bhopal district from August 1. In rural areas, tax charges will be collected by ‘Tax Sakhi’. According to the reports, tax collection in rural areas was started during year 2022 with an aim to make the Panchayat a stronger system. With tax collection in villages, Panchayat got their own fund. These funds were used for development works including streetlights, door-to-door garbage collection, sewage, road etc. Last year, during Vidhan Sabha election villagers were provided relaxation and tax collection was put on hold and till then, the authority concerned had collected around 2.5 crores from 222 panchayats. Panchayat system charges Rs 200 as property tax, Rs 50 cleanliness cess, Rs 1400 annual business charges and Rs 60 to 100 for water cess.
 
While speaking to ‘The Hitavada’ Rituraj Singh, CEO District Panchayat said, “Cleanliness, water and property tax in villages are being re-started by the Panchayat. ‘Tax Sakhi’ will be roped in to collect taxes and this will help to promote development work in Panchayats.” He further informed that there are 4,434 people covered under 77 Panchayat of Phanda. Around 81.30 lakh will be collected from these people. He said till the tax collection process was put on hold, Rs 65.61 lakh were collected by ‘Tax Sakhi’ team. Talking about Berasia Panchayat, he said 7,203 people are covered under the tax collection and around 47.19 lakh will be collected from these people. While putting a halt on tax collection, the ‘Tax Sakhi’ team collected around Rs 35 lakh from Berasia. CEO Rituraj further said, however this is quite tough to collect the charges from villagers as they are annoyed by the new financial burden. He said, ‘Tax Sakhi’ are members of women self-help groups assigned to collect tax from villagers.
 
Two women from each village Panchayat are put on the task. They start collection around the tenth of every month with their working hours depending on how fast they are able to convince people to pay up. From total amount collected, ‘Tax Sakhi’ receives 10% commission, which can be from Rs 3000 to Rs 10,000 a month. Sonam Bai, a Tax Sakhi in Phanda Kala village Panchyat said, “Once we approach anyone for tax payment they get angry and refuse to pay.

Indian Express,2024-12-29 00:00:00,Best non-Hindi performances of 2024: From Allu Arjun’s powerful turn in Pushpa 2 to Anna Ben’s performance for the ages in Kottukkaali,"By this time, we all have best-of lists coming out of our ears, and I promise to keep this brief, but I couldn’t let 2024 go by without marking my top performances from amongst the non-Hindi films I managed to catch.

Most of them belong to Malayalam films, which were again, no surprises here, right on top of the movie totem pole. Two are from Tamil films, which use stars to tell powerful, sensitive tales. And one is from the Telugu film which has blown all existing box-office records to smithereens, its Hindi dubbed version having saved the industry from drowning.
Pushpa 2 box officeA still from Pushpa 2.

Let me begin with Allu Arjun’s act in Pushpa 2, which doubles down, unapologetically, on all the mega-loud elements it uses to pick up the threads on its hero’s doings, three years after the original. The dances are cringe-making, the dialogues are risible, the drama is doused with exaggerated mainstream tropes, but keeping it all together is Allu Arjun who goes at it all with ferocious conviction: the jaatra-sequence, as well as the one in which he takes on all comers, in his the sari-and-nath-feminine-divine-avatar, is powerfully, delightfully subversive.

UllozhukkuA still from Ullozhukku.

At the centre of Christo Tomy’s Ullozhukku (Undercurrents) is the fraught relationship between two women, Leelamma and Anju. The latter’s marriage to Leelamma’s son is short-lived for reasons that are made clear as the film bobs along, with flood waters rising, and a funeral getting delayed. Do the dead speak? The best intentions are undermined by deceit, but humans will always take the easy way out. Veteran actor Urvashi as Leelamma and Parvathy Thiruvothu as Anju are terrific, as is the film. You want faces? Take these home with you.

There’s a lot to like in Chidambaram’s Manjummel Boys, the highest-grossing Malayalam film till now, but it didn’t blow me away. Yes, the boys– grown men who behave like adolescent-boys-out- to-have-fun– do get stuck between narrow rocks and hard places, and the rescue act is suitably nerve-wracking, but everything proceeds according to plan. In all this, Soubin Shahir gave me one of my favourite acts of 2024, an actor who effortlessly steals entire movies, not just scenes.

It is one of the most layered films of the year, centre-staging Roshan Mathew and Darshana Rajendran’s lived-in performances of a couple straining at the edges, negotiating the cracks in their marriage on a holiday which spins out of control after an unexpected event.

Fahadh Faasil is having the time of his life in Jithu Madhavan’s Aavesham, as an eccentric, clad-in-all-white, festooned-with-gold-chains gangster who turns mentor to a bunch of cowed college boys. Women, as usual, show up only momentarily in this all-boys caper. The film sags in some places, but Fafa is unstoppable.

Meiyazhagan is an unusual bromance for testosterone-laden mainstream Tamil cinema, not just in its choice of story which proceeds at the placid pace of a bicycle– the choice of vehicle in the film—but also in the actors at the centre of it.

IMPHAL, Sep 9 : United Committee Manipur (UCM) president YK Dhiren has accused the Government of India of using Kuki narco-terrorists as part of their divide and rule policy to disturb the unity and integrity of Manipur.
He made the statement during an oath taking ceremony of   new office bearers of the UCM was held at Haying Khongbal Uphong Yumpham of Lainingthou Sanamahi Temple, today.  
Altogether 25 newly office bearers of the Committee took the oath which was administered by UCM consultative member Yumnamcha Dilipkumar.

YK Dhiren of UPF is the new president of UCM while Khuraijam Athouba of IPSA and Shanta Nahakpam of ACOAM-Lup are now the vice president and secretary general respectively of the Committee.
At the ceremony, YK Dhiren said that the turmoil which the State has been witnessing is the handiwork of the Government of India (GoI).
He claimed that GoI has been using Kuki narco terrorists to  implement their divide and rule policy in the State and create disunity among the people.
Facing the sinister design of the GoI won't be possible without people's uprising, Dhiren said.
It is doubtful that the GoI will work neutrally to end the conflict, he said while urging the people to get ready for another uprising.
Claiming that the GoI has been scheming to drive a wedge among the people since Manipur, an erstwhile kingdom, merged with India, Dhiren maintained that only unity among the people of Manipur can defy all designs to disturb the unity and integrity of the State.
Manipur is still intact because the people of Manipur have been resisting the plot of GoI to break the State apart whenever the situation demands, he said, adding that people should be aware of the motive of GoI.
Saying that UCM was formed following a people's uprising in 2021 to protect the  unity and integrity of Manipur, Dhiren maintained that UCM will continue to work on building a united  Manipur.
He also said that what UCM aspires is peaceful coexistence among the people of Manipur and not fostering enmity.
The primary mission of UCM is safeguarding Manipur and her people from forces which want to disintegrate the State, Dhiren said.

Hindustan Times,2024-09-16 00:00:00,Argentina legend drops huge 2026 FIFA World Cup prediction for Lionel Messi: 'And I have no doubt...',"Juan Roman Riquelme shared his prediction on Lionel Messi featuring in Argentina's 2026 FIFA World Cup title defence.
Lionel Messi was back in action on Sunday, and scored a brace in Inter Miami's 3-1 win vs Philadelphia Union. Before this match, the attacker was on the sidelines, having sustained an ankle injury during Argentina's win against Colombia in the Copa America final, on July 14.

With Argentina set to defend their FIFA World Cup title in 2026, many fans have been left wondering about the former Barcelona's star's availability, as he is already 37-years-old. Messi's former teammate and Argentina legend Juan Roman Riquelme feels that the Inter Miami star will feature in the tournament in 2026.

Speaking on AZZ channel, he said, ""Messi is reinventing himself. You never know what he can do. And I have no doubt that he will play in the next World Cup, he has to play. We will all be rooting for him to play. I don't tease him too much, but we talk a lot. That's why I think he's going to play. He's very good, it's something that's not normal. And to that, he adds that he really likes to compete. He's won a lot and he still wants to keep winning.""

On Sunday, Philadelphia opened the scoring in the second minute via Mikael Uhre. Messi led his side's comeback with a brace. In the 26th-minute, Messi received a pass from Luis Suarez, went past a defender and then drove it inside the left post to make it 1-1.

Then four minutes later, Messi received a cross and scored past the goalkeeper with a shot from 15 yards, to make it 2-1. In stoppage time of the second half, Messi found Suare, who made it 3-1.","The article talks about Juan Roman Riquelme's prediction on Lionel Messi featuring in Argentina's 2026 FIFA World Cup title defence. Riquelme believes that Messi, who is 37 years old, will still be playing at the highest level and will be a key part of Argentina's team in the tournament. Messi recently returned from injury and scored a brace in Inter Miami's 3-1 win over Philadelphia Union.",Sports,66,293

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna [JVP or People’s Liberation Front], which leads Sri Lanka’s ruling National People’s Power [NPP], could not have risen to power without widening its appeal and building a mass support base over the last few years, and the current political moment affords the party a chance to rewrite its history, general secretary Tilvin Silva said.

“When you want to obtain power, you need a mass support base,” he said on Friday (November 15, 2024), just as the NPP’s resounding win in the November 14 general elections became evident. Speaking to The Hindu at the party’s headquarters in Battaramulla near Colombo, Mr. Silva called the election win “a huge achievement”. “In particular, the victory in Jaffna and in the upcountry area, where we were able to defeat deeply entrenched traditional parties and political families. This gives us a real chance to build a united country,” he said, referring to the JVP’s historic win in the Tamil-majority northern district.

The Hindu,2025-01-01 00:00:00,"‘Disaster of severe nature:’ Delay may have robbed State of chance to secure additional aid, says Pinarayi","The State government will make the best of the opportunities opened up by the Centre’s decision to treat the Wayanad landslides as a “disaster of severe nature,” although the delay in informing the State about the Inter-Ministerial Central Team’s (IMCT) assessment may have robbed Kerala of an the opportunity to secure additional assistance, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday.

Briefing the media on Cabinet decisions, Mr. Vijayan also urged the Centre to take steps to write off the loans availed by the landslide survivors in full.

On a December 30 letter from the Union Home Ministry regarding the IMCT assessment, Mr. Vijayan said that the IMCT had conducted its inspection and submitted the recommendation to the Centre with its assessment that it is “disaster of severe nature” within a month of the calamity. As the high-level committee did not meet, this recommendation failed to see the light of day for two months, Mr. Vijayan alleged.

Kerala had the opportunity to secure additional social assistance from UN institutions and NGOs, if the State government had been informed of it within two months of the disaster. There is an uncertainty in this regard now considering the occurrence of disasters elsewhere in the country after the Meppadi landslides. But the State government will continue its efforts in this regard, he said.

In view of the Centre’s letter, the State government will explore the possibility of using 25% of centrally-aided projects for disaster mitigation. The State can also demand an additional 50% of the allocation for the ‘Scheme for Special Assistance to State for Capital Investment’ for disaster mitigation and reconstruction. Further, Kerala can also request MPs across the country for allocation of funds for Wayanad rehabilitation, Mr. Vijayan said.

The Chief Minister pointed out that the December 30 letter (sent to Tinku Biswal, Principal Secretary, Revenue and Disaster Management, Kerala), has no mention of any financial assistance or waiver of loans of the survivors.","The Kerala government is leveraging the Centre’s classification of the Wayanad landslides as a “disaster of severe nature” to seek additional aid, despite delays in communication that may have affected potential assistance. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan urged the Centre to write off loans for affected survivors and criticized the two-month delay in informing the State about the Inter-Ministerial Central Team’s (IMCT) assessment. The State plans to utilize centrally-aided projects and request additional funds for disaster mitigation and reconstruction.

The Arunachal Times,2024-10-11 00:00:00,State News APLS bids adieu to pioneer journalist Pradeep Kuma,"The Arunachal Pradesh Literary Society (APLS), led by its President Yeshe Dorjee Thongchi, felicitated its founder member and the state’s pioneer journalist, Pradeep Kumar Behera, in a function at the Arunachal Press Club (APC) here on Thursday before his departure to his native state Odisha, following his retirement.

The APLS was set up in 2006 by a group of literature enthusiasts, with Thongchi, Mamang Dai and Behera as its president, general secretary and publicity secretary, respectively, with the motto ‘Start Writing, Keep Writing’, which spread a wave across the state for the growth of literary activities.
Reading out the citation, Thongchi said, “Behera came here in 1983 to serve at the Donyi-Polo Vidya Bhavan and launched the weekly Echo of Arunachal on 20.02.88, when there was no newspaper in this remote state. He also served as the editor of The Arunachal Times, Arunachal Front and Arunachal Observer, besides as a stringer for the UNI, PTI and ANI, and also wrote for magazines and periodicals as a columnist to become a god-fatherly figure to motivate and guide young scribes.”

Behera was instrumental in activating the APC, and served as its president for two terms, and was also the chief adviser to the APC and the Arunachal Pradesh Union of Working Journalists, besides being the chief adviser to the Arunachal Chamber of Commerce & Industries.

 “His motivation, particularly in creative writing and composing poems in various languages on the spot, had popularised the APLS across the state and inspired young writers, thereby facilitating the growth of literature and journalism in the state,” Thongchi said, before lauding Behera’s wife, Kalpalata Behera, for supporting him.

“‘Aadmi musafir hai, aata hai jaata hai; Aate jaate raste me yaadein chhod jaata hai (Man being mortal, gets born and die, but leaves behind memories)’,” which sometimesis not possible for others to emulate,” said the state’s first chief minister Prem Khandu Thungon after felicitating Behera to the thunderous applause of the gathering, including APLS members and scribes.
“Behera is a glittering example of the adage, ‘As you sow, so shall you reap’, as during those tough days, without any facilities in the state, he dared to face all challenges while endearing himself to all Arunachal communities, for which the Arunachalees made him what he is today,”Thungon said.

ICR DC Talo Potom said that Behera was instrumental in the formation of the Tani Jagriti Foundation for protecting and promoting Donyi-Poloism “as he had approached me in writing during the 1992 Donyi Polo Day celebration.”

“Behera has been a multilingual spot-poet but served a beacon to invigorate others by his thought-provoking creative writings which will continue to inspire all in the state,” said former APLS general secretary Tokong Pertin.

Terming Behera a legend, APC Vice President Bengia Ajum recalled that Behera, along with late Ravindran and late Taro Chatung, by their services had turned the harsh situation favourable for journalism.
Informing about her write-up on yeti, which was published in Echo of Arunachal, Mamang Dai recalled that Behera had met her and persuaded her to return to the state. “When I first served for Sentinel and then Hindustan Times, Telegraph and The Arunachal Times, Behera was the only non-local journalist in the state to give a new turn to the profession,” she said.
DNGC Principal Dr MQ Khan, IP Secretary Nyali Ete, IPR Director Onyok Pertin, and APLS AGS Dr Pekba Ringu also spoke on the occasion.

APLS general secretary Mukul Pathak, while describing Behera as “unstoppable,” said that he dedicated 41 years to the state through journalism, the APLS and other NGOs, “which will always be remembered.”

Behera recalled a few reports from the past, like the JK Rifles’ Havildar Shere Thapa killing 175 PLA jawans in Tama Chug Chung sector of Upper Subansiri district, and defined the media as ‘mein diya’. He urged mediapersons to “project Arunachal, or ‘Nilalaya’, in the right perspective, particularly the Tawang monastery, Bhismak Nagar, Malinithan, especially Dewakota shrine, where Guru Rimpoche, the 2nd Buddha, has hidden many sacred treasures.

“The shrine, 40 kms from Tuting in Upper Siang district,remains submerged under the Nyigong river. This would woo religions tourists to tap the state’s vast tourism potential,” he said.

He termed Thongchi “a living Buddha who won the Sahitya Akademi Award-2005 for his Assamese novel Mauna Outh Mukhar Hriday (Silent Lips, Murmuring Heart) and was conferred with the Padma Shri in 2020 for his work in the field of literature and education.

Behera said that he might go away physically but his soul would remain in Arunachal, and expressed his wish to be born in Arunachal in his next life.

He recited a self-composed poem at the conclusion.

","

The Arunachal Pradesh Literary Society (APLS), led by President Yeshe Dorjee Thongchi, honored pioneer journalist Pradeep Kumar Behera during a function at the Arunachal Press Club (APC) on Thursday, before his departure to Odisha post-retirement. Behera, a founding member of APLS, played a crucial role in establishing journalism in Arunachal Pradesh, launching the weekly *Echo of Arunachal* in 1988 when no newspapers existed in the state.

Thongchi highlighted Behera's contributions as editor of *The Arunachal Times*, *Arunachal Front*, and *Arunachal Observer*, and praised his mentorship of young writers. Behera, who served two terms as APC president, was also instrumental in the formation of the Tani Jagriti Foundation to promote Donyi-Poloism.

Former Chief Minister Prem Khandu Thungon commended Behera for overcoming challenges in his journalistic journey, and APLS General Secretary Mukul Pathak described him as “unstoppable” for dedicating 41 years to journalism and community service. 

Behera expressed gratitude, stating that although he may leave physically, his spirit would remain in Arunachal, and he hopes to be reborn in the state. The event celebrated his legacy, inspiring current and future generations of writers and journalists.",Human Interest,183,774
Mint,2025-01-02 00:00:00,Mutual Funds: Why passive funds can be a great choice for retail investors to invest in 2025?,"If you are planning to invest in mutual funds this year, one of the dilemmas you may face is choosing between active and passive mutual funds.
With the benchmark index facing extreme volatility and having lost nearly 10 per cent off its peak, the scope of growth seems promising in this segment. It's a different matter that some of the losses have already been pared, with Nifty50 rising by nearly 2 per cent on the second session of 2025, i.e., on Thursday.
Moreover, Sebi has rolled out the mutual fund lite framework, following which index funds are likely to get a shot in the arm.
The latest guidelines underscore uniform guidelines for launching equity passive schemes. With the entry barrier for launching index mutual funds kept lower for passive schemes under this framework, retail investors are expected to find these schemes far more lucrative and tempting.
The Sebi's Lite framework provides a good opportunity for investors to invest in passive funds. They have brought in uniformity in regulations for passive schemes, it is quite a welcoming move for the first time investors, says Sridharan S., a Sebi-registered investment advisor and founder of Wealth Ladder Direct.
What are passive schemes?For the unversed, passive schemes refer to mutual funds that invest in the stocks in a pre-defined ratio and in accordance with pre-defined criteria, which is the same as that of a benchmark index.
For instance, a passive scheme that tracks the Nifty 100 index will invest in the same stocks and in the same proportion as Nifty 100 does.
As a result, the performance delivered by the mutual fund is the same as that of index, albeit subject to some tracking error.
This means that, unlike active fundswhich may fail to beat the benchmark returnspassive funds give far more predictable returns.
Over three quarters of active equity large cap funds (77 per cent) underperformed the benchmark, as per the SPIVA India Focus report - is a case in point. In case of mid/small cap category, 52 percent of active funds underperformed in H1 2024.
Why should you invest in index funds?There are 270 index funds with total assets under management (AUMs) of  2.73 lakh crore and 214 ETFs with total AUMs of  7.85 lakh crore, shows the AMFI (Association of Mutual Funds in India) data as on Nov 30, 2024.
Passive mutual funds enable investors to earn the returns along the lines of a benchmark index such as Nifty 50.
For instance, if someone had invested on January 1 last year in a passive fund which tracks Nifty50 then by the end of 2024, that scheme would have delivered the same return as that of Nifty 50 i.e., nearly 8.8 per cent return.
Likewise, if you are tempted by a particlar sector, say IT, then you could opt for a scheme that tracks Nifty IT index. Else, if you want an exposure to mid cap stocks, you could simply invest in a passive fund that tracks Nifty mid cap 100 or BSE mid cap index.
Sounds simple? Isn't it?
Alternatively, if you opt for an active mutual fund, you are expected to exercise due caution and check the past returns of that scheme, besides the performance delivered by the fund managers who manage that scheme. All these considerations are rendered insignificant in passive schemes.
This is because the returns given by the schemes across fund houses and fund managers would be the same (subject to tracking error) as long as the benchmark index is the same.
It makes the investing decision of investor simpler since s/he doesn't need to keep track of different fund houses and their performance with regards to different schemes.
Given a high concentration of index funds that are expected to deliver returns on predictable lines, investors find these schemes quite tempting and investible.
As more and more investors understand that generating alpha for a longer period from active mutual funds is not easy, they are more interested in passive mutual funds, which are very cost-effective and a no-brainer for the investors, says Preeti Zende, founder of Apna Dhan Financial Services.","Sebi has rolled out the mutual fund lite framework, following which index funds are likely to get a shot in the arm.

Hindustan News,2024-12-31 00:00:00,‘Then quit’: Swiggy delivery girl trolled after revealing the ‘hardest part’ of her job. ,"A Swiggy delivery rider expressed frustration over long wait times and crowds in malls, suggesting food orders be sent to lower floors to save time. A woman working as a delivery rider for Swiggy has revealed the “hardest” and most hated part of the gig. Amritha works as a Swiggy agent part time while completing her education to earn extra extra money. In a viral Instagram Reel, she revealed that the worst part of her job is walking through Asia’s second-largest mall to collect orders - a process she called time-consuming and tiring.In her video, Amritha revealed that Swiggy pays a minimum of ₹25 for a delivery distance of 5 km. However, collecting orders from the mall means that delivery riders lose out on a good 15 to 20 minutes of their day. She requested Swiggy to consider paying their drivers extra if they have to walk such long distances just to collect an order before delivering it to the customer.

“No extra allowance”
In her post, the Swiggy delivery rider, who goes by “amriithah” on Instagram, explained that delivery agents have to first park their vehicles in a separate parking area at the mall. Then they take the service elevator to the food court and walk a fair distance to the restaurant from where they have to collect the order. The whole process takes at least 10 to 20 minutes.Exiting the mall through the normal exit is also an arduous process as the place is usually crowded, she explained.

“There is no extra allowance for these orders. We almost lose 10-20 minutes just to take those orders. Also after taking the orders we have to take the normal exit which is also crowded normally,” she wrote on Instagram.","Amritha, a Swiggy delivery rider, shared her frustration with long wait times and crowds at malls, particularly Asia's second-largest mall, where she collects orders.

The Telegraph,2024-07-07 00:00:00,It's France's moment of truth. Here's how its snap elections work and what comes next,"Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration, nationalist party National Rally stands a chance of winning a legislative majority for the first time, but the outcome remains uncertain. French voters face a decisive choice Sunday in the runoff of snap parliamentary elections that could produce the country's first far-right government since the World War II Nazi occupation — or no majority emerging at all. Marine Le Pen's anti-immigration, nationalist party National Rally stands a chance of winning a legislative majority for the first time, but the outcome remains uncertain because of a complex voting system and tactical maneuvers by political parties. Voters across France and overseas territories can cast ballots for 501 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly, the lower and most important of France's two houses of parliament. The other 76 races were won outright in the first round of voting. The National Rally and its allies arrived ahead in Round 1 with around one-third of the votes. A coalition of center-left, hard-left and greens parties called the New Popular Front came in second position, ahead of President Emmanuel Macron's struggling centrist alliance.

In the frantic week between the two rounds, hundreds of centrist and left-wing candidates pulled out of races to boost the chances of their moderate rivals and try to keep National Rally candidates from winning. Final pre-election polls suggest that tactic may have diminished the far right's chances of an absolute majority. But Le Pen's party has wider and deeper support than ever before, and it's up to voters to decide. Polling projections suggest the National Rally is likely to have the most seats in the next National Assembly -- which would be a historic first.

If it wins an absolute majority of 289 seats, Macron would be expected to appoint National Rally president Jordan Bardella as France's new prime minister. Bardella could then form a government, and he and Macron would share power in a system called 'cohabitation.''

If the party doesn't win a majority but still has a large number of seats, Macron could name Bardella anyway, though the National Rally might refuse out of fears that its government could be ejected in a no-confidence vote.

Or Macron could choose a prime minister from the center-left and seek to build a coalition with moderates.

If there's no party with a clear mandate to govern, Macron could name a government of experts unaffiliated with political parties. Such a government would likely deal mostly with day-to-day affairs of keeping France running.

Complicating matters: Any of those options would require parliamentary approval.

If political talks take too long amid summer holidays and the July 26-Aug. 11 Olympics in Paris, Macron's centrist government could keep a transitional government pending further decisions.

How does cohabitation work?

If an opposition force wins a majority, Macron would be forced to appoint a prime minister belonging to that new majority. In this 'cohabitation,'' the government would implement policies that diverge from the president's plan.

France's modern Republic has experienced three cohabitations, the last one under conservative President Jacques Chirac, with Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, from 1997 to 2002.

The prime minister is accountable to the parliament, leads the government and introduces bills.

The president is weakened at home during cohabitation, but still holds some powers over foreign policy, European affairs and defense and is in charge of negotiating and ratifying international treaties. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces, and holds the nuclear codes.

What about a hung parliament?

While not uncommon in other European countries, modern France has never experienced a parliament with no dominant party.

Such a situation requires lawmakers to build consensus across parties to agree on government positions and legislation. France's fractious politics and deep divisions over taxes, immigration and Mideast policy make that especially challenging.

That would likely derail Macron's promises to overhaul unemployment benefits or legalize life-ending procedures for the terminally ill, among other reforms. It could also make passing a budget more difficult.

Why is the far right rising?

While France has one of the world's biggest economies and is an important diplomatic and military power, many French voters are struggling with inflation and low incomes and a sense that they are being left behind by globalization.

Le Pen's party, which blames immigration for many of France's problems, has tapped into that voter frustration and built wide online support and a grassroots network, notably in small towns and farming communities that see the Paris political class as out of touch.

Why does it matter?

The National Assembly is the more powerful of France's two houses of parliament. It has the final say in the law-making process over the Senate, dominated by conservatives.

Macron has a presidential mandate until 2027, and said he would not step down before the end of his term. But a weakened French president could complicate many issues on the world stage.

During previous cohabitations, defense and foreign policies were considered the informal domain of the president, who was usually able to find compromises with the prime minister to allow France to speak with one voice abroad.

Yet today, both the far-right and the leftist coalition's views in these areas differ radically from Macron's approach and would likely be a subject of tension during a potential cohabitation.

Bardella said that as a prime minister, he would oppose sending French troops to Ukraine — a possibility Macron has not ruled out. Bardella also said he would refuse French deliveries of long-range missiles and other weaponry capable of striking targets within Russia itself.
","Polling projections suggest the National Rally is poised to secure the most seats in the next French National Assembly, potentially leading to its president, Jordan Bardella, becoming prime minister if they win an absolute majority. This scenario would lead to 'cohabitation,' where Bardella and President Macron share power, potentially resulting in policy conflicts. If the National Rally wins many seats but not a majority, Macron might still appoint Bardella, though the party may decline due to risks of a no-confidence vote. Alternatively, Macron could form a coalition with moderates or appoint a non-partisan government for day-to-day affairs, though all options need parliamentary approval.

Cohabitation weakens the president domestically but maintains control over foreign policy, European affairs, and defense. France has experienced cohabitation thrice, last under President Chirac and Prime Minister Jospin. A hung parliament, unprecedented in modern France, would necessitate cross-party consensus, challenging given the country's political divisions and complicating Macron's reform agenda.

The far-right's rise, driven by voter frustration with economic issues and immigration, poses significant implications. The National Assembly's power in law-making underscores the importance of this election. Bardella's potential opposition to military support for Ukraine could strain Macron's foreign policy, highlighting the stakes in this political shift.",International News,200,923
The Telegraph,2024-12-28 00:00:00,"Derby delight, when former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wowed Salt Lake Stadium","On January 12, 2005, just a few months into his first term as Prime Minister, Singh, who passed away in New Del­hi on Thursday, came to Calcutta to inaugurate the National Football League.

Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh walked on the Salt Lake Stadium turf almost 20 years ago.

On January 12, 2005, just a few months into his first term as Prime Minister, Singh, who passed away in New Del­hi on Thursday, came to Calcutta to inaugurate the National Football League. The season would start off with a clash between East Bengal and Mohun Bagan.

Calcutta has seen former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi inaugurating the first Nehru Gold Cup at Eden Gardens in 1982 and also in 1984, but Manmohan remains the only Prime Minister to touch down in the city to inaugurate the country’s premier league.

The then All India Football Federation president and Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who had key portfolios like parliamentary affairs and information and broadcasting, had invited him. Manmohan Singh’s wife Gursharan Kaur, then defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee were also in attendance.

“Das Munshi was a respected politician. He invited Singh and that boosted the prestige of the NFL,” former AIFF top official Alberto Colaco told The Telegraph on Friday.

During Das Munshi’s tenure as AIFF president, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee inaugurated the 1999 NFL and Manmohan also did the honours in 2007, both in New Delhi.

On that 2005 January afternoon at the Salt Lake Stadium, the match had ended goalless and Syed Rahim Nabi walked away with the player of the match award.

“I remember our coach (Subhas Bhowmick) had said not to get carried away by our Prime Minister’s presence,” Nabi said.

A versatile footballer who could play in any position, Bhowmick had experimented with Nabi as a retractable wing-back and the former India footballer was a constant threat on the flank. “It was a big day for me,” Nabi added.

The derby is a distant memory for most of the players who featured in that match. East Bengal’s Alvito D’Cunha and Mehtab Hossain of Mohun Bagan can vaguely remember.

“Almost 20 years. Yes respected Manmohan Singh was there,” said Alvito. “I was very young. Our Prime Minister had come, I can recollect. Bablu da (Subrata Bhattacharya) was our coach,” Mehtab said. “Sunil (Chhetri) and I had just started out,” Mehtab added. “It was my first season in Bagan,” Mehrajuddin Wadoo said.

But ex-goalkeeper Sangram Mukherjee, the East Bengal captain for that season, remembers the day well.

“Being the captain I had the honour of introducing my teammates to Manmohan Singh. It was a red-letter day for me. You do not get to meet the Prime Minister just like that,” Mukherjee said. “I was cautious when the match began. I did not want to botch up with him watching from the VIP enclosure.”

“I was lucky to meet our present Prime Minister Narendra Modiji during the inauguration of the Howrah Metro earlier this year. That’s because I am an employee of the Metro Railway. As a player, Manmohan Singh remains the only Prime Minister I shook hands with. That came to my mind after the news of his death broke,” Mukherjee said.

Those were the days when the imposing stadium had more capacity and there were bare minimum security protocols. However, that derby saw unprecedented arrangements and traffic regulations.

“We had reached two hours before the afternoon kick-off,” a fan said.","Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who passed away in New Delhi on Thursday, visited Calcutta on January 12, 2005, to inaugurate the National Football League at the Salt Lake Stadium during his first term as Prime Minister.

Singh’s visit was significant as he remains the only Prime Minister to inaugurate the country’s premier league in Calcutta, a city previously visited by Indira Gandhi for football events. The event was organized by then AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, with dignitaries like Gursharan Kaur, Pranab Mukherjee, and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in attendance.

Players and officials recall the day fondly. East Bengal’s captain Sangram Mukherjee introduced his teammates to Singh and described the occasion as a “red-letter day.” Other players, including Mehtab Hossain and Mehrajuddin Wadoo, remember the match as an early milestone in their careers.

The event featured heightened security measures and traffic regulations, reflecting the significance of the Prime Minister’s presence. Fans and players alike cherished the historic day in Indian football.",Sports,194,579

Several lorries were stranded on the Hyderabad-Vijayawada National Highway near Kodada due to water flowing on road. The officials urged those travelling to Vijayawada to use the Narkatpalli-Addanki highway as an alternative.

The rains caused rivulet Munneru to swell and overflow, leading to floods in nearby localities. Residents of the area said that the water entered their homes and their household items were washed away as the water started receding.
The Met Centre in Telangana said heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places in Adilabad, Komaram Bheem Asifabad, Nirmal, Nizamabad, Jagtial, Sangareddy, Medak, Kamareddy districts till 8.30 am on September 3.
It also said thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) are very likely to occur at isolated places in many districts of Telangana during this period. It issued a yellow alert for this forecast.
To take stock of the situation, PM Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Revanth Reddy and assured all possible assistance to the state.

","Heavy rains in Telangana have resulted in the deaths of at least 16 people and caused extensive damage across the state. The Telangana government, led by Revanth Reddy, has announced an ex-gratia payment of ₹5 lakh for the families of those killed and has requested immediate assistance from the central government. The state estimates the damage at ₹5,000 crore and has sought ₹2,000 crore in aid, urging the central government to declare the floods a national calamity.

The relentless rainfall has flooded low-lying areas, destroyed crops, and disrupted transportation, particularly between Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. In Khammam, severe flooding led to extensive property damage, with household items being washed away. The heavy rain has also caused the rivulet Munneru to overflow, affecting nearby localities.

The Hindu,2024-06-30 00:00:00,PUCL demands release of its executive committee member and other tribal activists,"The People’s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL) on Saturday demanded the immediate release of all tribal activists who have been arrested in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar over the past few years, including PUCL executive committee member Suneeta Pottam.

“Release all Tribal activists and innocent villagers arrested in the last few years, including Sunita Pottam, Surju Tekam, and other Moolwasi Bahao Manch activists at the earliest; FIRs be lodged and police investigation be undertaken against the false cases filed against all Tribals including activists,” it said, also demanding that first information reports (FIRs) be filed regarding several recent encounters with security forces listed by the organisation.

It has also sought a judicial commission headed by a Supreme Court judge to enquire into those encounters; the creation of conditions for peace and security talks with the local population, Adivasi community, and the Communist Party of India (Maoist); an end to the targeting of democratic rights activists; and the lifting of all restrictions on democratic movements.

Encounter deaths
In a statement, PUCL alleged that over the past six months, more than 150 people in Bastar were killed in counter insurgency operations by security forces. “We also are concerned at the indiscriminate arrests of activists, in particular 26-year-old Suneeta Pottam, a young Tribal activist associated with the PUCL, and Moolvasi Bachao Manch senior activist Surju Tekam and others who are raising their voice against the unchecked human rights violation in Bastar,” it said.

“It should be known that Sunita Pottam as a minor, had filed a PIL along with another activist in the Supreme Court of India (SC) on the extra judicial killings taking place in Bastar, in 2017. She also went up to the National Human Rights Commission with similar complaints in 2022, along with the false cases that were filed against her. She also exposed through fact findings the sexual violence that took place in Bijapur in 2016,” the PUCL said.

The PUCL alleged that many of those killed in the encounters were ordinary villagers, some of whom had been identified as minors.

Activist arrested
“What is alarming is that instead of trying to build trust in the citizenry by holding independent probes into these incidents, the Chhattisgarh government has reacted by arresting one of the foremost activists from Bijapur... Suneeta Pottam, on June 3. Suneeta Pottam had protested the spate of extra judicial killings of villagers in Kadenar, Palnar, Korcholi, Andri, and Peddakorma in Bijapur in 2016 by gathering evidence that the deceased were ordinary villagers shot in cold blood, and filing a Public Interest Litigation on this before the Chhattisgarh High Court, seeking an independent Special Investigation Team to inquire into these,” said the PUCL.

Ms. Pottam is also a member of the national-level organisation, Women against Sexual Violence and State Repression, since 2015.","The People’s Union For Civil Liberties (PUCL) is demanding the release of tribal activists, including Suneeta Pottam, who have been arrested in Chhattisgarh's Bastar region over recent years. They are also calling for judicial inquiries into encounter deaths and an end to human rights violations against activists and villagers in the area.",Crime and Justice,52,462
DNA,2024-07-16 00:00:00,DNA TV Show: Why is there uproar over construction of Kedarnath temple in Delhi?,"A temple of Lord Shiva is being built in Delhi's Burari. This temple is being built in the name of Shri Kedarnath Dham and the Bhoomi Pujan of this temple took place on July 10. Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami also attended the Bhoomi Pujan. It is being claimed that this temple will be built on 3 acres of land by Shri Kedarnath Dham Trust Burari. The trust says that the doors of Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand remain closed for 6 months, that's why this temple is being built. There is a plan to make this temple exactly like Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand and this is the subject of controversy.

The priests of Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand allege that the construction of the Kedarnath temple in Delhi is against religious tradition. The priests say that by doing this, an attempt is being made to tamper with Hindu traditions. The saints say that by taking the stone from Kedarnath Dham and installing it in Delhi, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami has tampered with the tradition of Kedarnath Dham. They say that Kedarnath Dham is only one and will remain one. No one can replace Kedarnath Dham.

Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, the Shankaracharya of the Jyotish Peeth in Uttarakhand, who turned down the invitation to the Ram temple consecration ceremony in Ayodhya, said, ""When the address for Kedarnath is in the Himalayas, how can it be in Delhi?"" The saints and sages of Kedarnath Dham have started a protest against the Kedarnath temple being built in Delhi. The priests of Kedarnath Dham are continuously protesting against it and are warning that if the decision to build the Kedarnath Dham temple in Delhi is not withdrawn, then there will be a movement.Meanwhile, Ajendra Ajay, President of Shri Badrinath- Kedarnath Temple Committee, said, ""The Uttarakhand government has nothing to do with this temple. The Chief Minister had attended the foundation stone laying ceremony of this temple on the request of saints and some public representatives...""","The construction of a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, named Shri Kedarnath Dham, has sparked controversy in Delhi's Burari. The temple, planned on a 3-acre plot, mimics the Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand, with its Bhoomi Pujan attended by Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami. However, priests and saints from Kedarnath Dham in Uttarakhand oppose the temple's construction, citing it as against religious traditions. They argue that Kedarnath Dham is unique and cannot be replicated elsewhere. Swami Avimukteshwaranand Saraswati, Shankaracharya of the Jyotish Peeth, emphasized the spiritual and geographical significance of Kedarnath being in the Himalayas, questioning its replication in Delhi. Despite protests, the Uttarakhand government asserts no involvement in the temple's construction beyond the Chief Minister's ceremonial presence at its foundation stone laying ceremony.",Religion and Spirituality,124,332
The statesman ,2024-11-03 00:00:00,"Not quite unhinged, but are we getting there","Have you ever found yourself struggling to find a decent cabinet hinge? Or heard about a recent spate of cabinet hinge related disasters, turning it into a pressing problem for the public? Well, even if you haven’t, the government is stepping in to help. A new 18-page quality standard, devised by a 26-member committee, will mandate various tests on cabinet hinges like slamming them shut 10 times (or a 100 more times if they have dampers). If you are satisfied with the current state of cabinet 

The government claims these measures will “encourage” manufacturers to improve quality. However, it is important to understand the unintended consequences of such policies. Consider four important outcomes. First, price hikes. As manufacturers are forced to comply with these new standards, their costs will go up and consumers will face higher prices. Second, fewer choices. Some manufacturers may find it too expensive to comply and simply stop producing hinges altogether, eliminating options that buyers were previously happy with. Third, reduced innovation. With such detailed specifications, it will become more costly and risky for manufacturers to innovate. Some new designs might fail these specific tests, even if they are superior products overall.

Fourth, increased lobbying. Large manufacturers have the resources to influence government standards, ensuring the rules favour their products. Smaller companies, on the other hand, are left unable to compete. The unspoken justification for such regulations, known as Quality Control Orders (QCOs), is to restrict imports and boost domestic manufacturers. But this reasoning falls short. Take the same cabinet hinge as an example. While it might appear that domestic hinge producers are being shielded from foreign competition and given room to grow, the broader impact on the manufacturing ecosystem tells a different story. Cabinet makers, who rely on hinges as an essential input, will lose access to the best quality hinges at the best prices, which may come from imports.

","The government is introducing an 18-page quality standard for cabinet hinges, requiring rigorous testing. While intended to improve quality, this could lead to higher prices, fewer choices, reduced innovation, and increased lobbying by large manufacturers. The regulations may protect domestic producers but could harm cabinet makers by limiting access to high-quality, affordable hinges, ultimately disrupting the manufacturing ecosystem.

DNA,2024-08-29 00:00:00,"IPL 2025: Players who can attract bid of more than Rs 20 crore in IPL Mega Auction, check list here","As the Indian Premier League (IPL) gears up for its mega auction in 2025, the cricketing world is abuzz with speculation about which players could command the highest prices. The IPL, known for its high-stakes auctions, often sees franchises splurging millions on top talent. This year, three players stand out as potential candidates to fetch a staggering ₹20 crore or more.

Travis Head

The 30-year-old Australian cricketer has established himself as an explosive and an impactful player. He has helped Australia win the ODI World Cup 2023 and World Test Championship 2023, in which he was man of the match for both the finals. He was in red-hot form in IPL 2024 as well, in which he smashed 567 runs with a magnificent strike rate of 191.55. IPL teams won't hesitate to spend money on him in the IPL mega auction with the firepower and reliability he offers.
Cummins

Another Australian on the list, Pat Cummins, is also the captain of his national team and also has a staggering fan base in India. His captaincy skills with fast-paced bowling and ability to bat can contribute in the Mega Auction. He has already crossed the 20 crore mark in the IPL Auction once in the IPL 2024 Auction where he was brought by the Sunrises Hyderabad at a price of Rs 20.50 crores. For franchises looking to add a captain and a fast bowler who can bring an ideology to the team, he can be the best buy possible.

KL Rahul

KL Rahul has been consistent in his performance in the IPL throughout the years. He has grown from a mere talented young man to one of the most consistent openers of the IPL tournament. His run-scoring and captaincy for the Lucknow Super Giants put other aspects of his worth into perspective.

Rahul’s style of play, especially against the fast bowlers, and his ability to score big when the team is in a spot of bother makes him a hot property. In the list of players, teams are looking to strengthen their top order. Looking at his recent performances in IPL where he is among the top run-scorers every season, the 20 crore valuation does not seem unrealistic. Especially when the franchise needs a reliable opening batsman and a future player for the team that they can bank upon.
 
The IPL auction is a blend of the current performances, future prospects, the market trend, team management, and player’s story. Pat Cummins is a leader of the team, KL Rahul is very consistent and Head is a power hitter, all these players can cost more than ₹20 crore.

However, the actual bidding will also depend on the purse availability of teams, their existing squad and how much they rate every player in terms of their contribution to the overall team’s formation strategy.

These three players are sure to be in the hot seat of the bidding war if they are not retained before the IPL 2025 mega auction, which is expected to happen between December 2024 and February 2025. Since each team can retain only 3–4 players, the auction is set to be an interesting event where franchises would try to bag the best of talents for the next season’s team.

Business Standard,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Data that powers artificial intelligence is disappearing a rapid pace,"For years, the people building powerful artificial intelligence systems have used enormous troves of text, images and videos pulled from the internet to train their models.

Now, that data is drying up.
Click here to connect with us on WhatsApp


Over the past year, many of the most important web sources used for training AI models have restricted the use of their data, according to a study published this week by the Data Provenance Initiative, an MIT-led research group.


The study, which looked at 14,000 web domains that are included in three commonly used AI training data sets, discovered an “emerging crisis in consent,” as publishers and online platforms have taken steps to prevent their data from being harvested.

The researchers estimate that in the three data sets — called C4, RefinedWeb and Dolma — 5 per cent of all data, and 25 per cent of data from the highest-quality sources, has been restricted. Those restrictions are set up through the Robots Exclusion Protocol, a decades-old method for website owners to prevent automated bots from crawling their pages using a file called robots.txt.
The study also found that as much as 45 per cent of the data in one set, C4, had been restricted by websites’ terms of service. “We’re seeing a rapid decline in consent to use data across the web that will have ramifications not just for AI companies, but for researchers, academics and noncommercial entities,” said Shayne Longpre, the study’s lead author, in an interview.

Data is the main ingredient in today’s generative AI systems, which are fed billions of examples of text, images and videos. Much of that data is scraped from public websites by researchers and compiled in large data sets, which can be downloaded and freely used, or supplemented with data from other sources. Learning from that data is what allows generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and Anthropic’s Claude to write, code and generate images and videos. The more high-quality data is fed into these models, the better their outputs generally are.

For years, AI developers were able to gather data fairly easily. But the generative AI boom of the past few years has led to tensions with the owners of that data — many of whom have misgivings about being used as AI training fodder, or at least want to be paid for it. As the backlash has grown, some publishers have set up paywalls or changed their terms of service to limit the use of their data for AI training. Others have blocked the automated web crawlers used by companies like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.

Sites like Reddit and StackOverflow have begun charging A.I. companies for access to data, and a few publishers have taken legal action — including The New York Times, which sued OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement last year, alleging that the companies used news articles to train their models without permission.
Companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta have gone to extreme lengths in recent years to gather more data to improve their systems.More recently, some AI companies have struck deals with publishers including The Associated Press and News Corp, the owner of The Wall Street Journal, giving them ongoing access to their content.

the morung express,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Farmers in Dhansiripar and Peren dist grapple with rising elephant intrusions,"Farmers in villages under Dhansiripar sub-division and adjoining Beisumpuikam village under Peren district are facing significant challenges as elephants increasingly venture into their plantations and fields, causing extensive damage to crops. These visits have become more frequent, leading to substantial economic losses to the villagers. 

This situation is seen as a classic case of human-animal conflict, where expanding human settlements and agricultural activities intersect with the natural habitats of wildlife. This not only leads to the destruction of crops and property but also poses significant risks to both human and animal lives. 

One affected farmer, Changduing Daime from Beisumpuikam, told The Morung Express that his banana and papaya crops which he planted in hisareca nut farmwere recently damaged by the elephants. 


Footprints of wild elephant are seen on a field at Doyapur. 
The young farmer said he earns between 5000-10,000 per month from his plantation of banana and papaya during seasons which he sells in Dimapur, Kohima and Senapati in Manipur. 

Changduing said this has been a major setback to his livelihood, while revealing that at least 20-30 percent of his plantation have so far been damaged by elephants. “The frequency of elephants venturing into our area of cultivation is also increasing which is concerning,” he further stated. 

Expressing concern over the situation, BeisumpuikamVillage Council Chairman, Tadi Zeliang noted that the elephants are now entering the village jurisdiction almost daily, sometime even venturing into the village itself. 

“This frequent intrusion had made it increasingly difficult for villagers, especially children and farmers, to venture into the forest or their fields,” he highlighted.

“Those searching for animal fodder are particularly at risk, as elephants tend to frequent areas with lush vegetation. However, as farmers, we have no choice as we have to tend to our fields and plantation every day,” he lamented. 

In response to elephant sightings, villagers are usually alerted through a public address system. Despite these precautions, the frequency of elephant’sincursionshas been rising year by year, Zeliang said.


Crops destroyed by wild elephants at Doyapur.
The council chairman also highlighted the unique challenges of dealing with elephants compared to other animals, emphasizing the difficulty and danger involved in managing these encounters. A member of the village council mentioned that the forest department intervenes by attempting to chase the elephants away, but their efforts can only do so much.

This year, a lone elephant has been observed to be the culprit behind the damage to the crops, Beisumpuikam farmers, meanwhile, reported. 

“We need a more effective measure to address the growing issue, as the persistent presence of elephants continues to threaten our safety and livelihood,” they voiced out. 

The neighbouring village of Manglumukh, located just before reaching Beisumpuikam, is facing similar situation. Farmers have reported frequent elephant intrusion, resulting substantial crop damage. 

According to Bejon, a farmer from Manglumukh, large expanse of banana plantations belonging to four families were damaged recently by the visiting elephants. Other than that, numerous areca nut, paddy, cabbage, pumpkin and watermelon fields were also destroyed, he stated.

“Villagers do not report all incidents of elephant damage to the concerned department because no action is taken,” Bejon stated. 

Manglumukh Village Council Chairman,Udil Haflongfar told The Morung Express that they had received reports of a herd of elephants spotted at Doyapur village area and moving towards Dhansirireserve forests in Assam where they usually originate from.

He expressed deep concern over the situation, noting that incidents of elephants raiding crops have become alarmingly common. In 2023, a woman from Manglumukh narrowly escaped death when she encountered an elephant on her way to the field. The sudden encounter left both the woman and the elephant startled that in their frantic attempts to escape, no harm came to her. 

A recent human and wildlife conflict survey carried out by the Wildlife Conservation Society of India (WCS-I), on elephant intrusion in the last five years, revealed that48.8 percent from Beisumpuikam village reported elephant damage to crops. 

This data was revealed by Sourav Dutta, Project Coordinator for Nagaland Conservation and Livelihood Project under WCS-I also revealed that in Manglumukh village, almost all household from the village reported of crop damage by elephants.

WCS-I is currently implementing the Integrated Tiger Habitat Conservation Programme, Phase-2 at six villages in the fringes of Ntangki National Park.In all of these villages, the engagement is with the communities, with special focus on the youth and the women to provide sustainable alternate livelihood.

In Doyapur village area, under Dhansiripar sub-division, a herd of elephants was reported to have stayed overnight a week ago, during which a large number of crops in fields and plantation were destroyed. 

A video clip shared by a farmer shows a herd of five elephants moving calmly through afield. The aftermath of their visit, as shown in other video clips and images, reveals destroyed paddy fields and plantations. 

Conservationists and affected farmers have observed that the elephants causing havoc in Beisumpuikam and surrounding villages in Dhansiripar sub-division in Dimapur district originate from the Dhansiri Reserve Forests. These elephants cross the Dhansiri River, moving towards Nagaland in search of fodder. 

Their migration pattern has been a part of their natural behaviours for ages, as the area is regarded as a traditional elephant corridor.","Farmers in Dhansiripar sub-division and Beisumpuikam village, Peren district, are facing severe economic losses due to frequent elephant intrusions into their fields. The elephants, migrating from Dhansiri Reserve Forests, are damaging crops such as bananas, papayas, and areca nuts. This human-wildlife conflict endangers both lives and livelihoods. Despite public alerts and efforts by the forest department, the issue persists, with increased encounters impacting daily life and safety. Conservationists and affected farmers seek more effective measures to address the problem and protect their crops.

INDIAN EXPRESS,2025-01-02 00:00:00,"Former Ranji player held for sending fake confirmed ticket messages, duping passengers at Pune railway station","A former Ranji player was arrested in Pune for allegedly duping passengers by sending fake confirmed train ticket messages. This incident has raised significant concerns about ticket fraud in the railway system, highlighting the need for increased vigilance among travelers.

The accused, leveraging his familiarity with the railway system, reportedly created and distributed fraudulent messages that mimicked legitimate ticket confirmations. Unsuspecting passengers received these messages, leading them to believe they had secured valid reservations for their journeys. The scam came to light when several passengers reported issues with their tickets, prompting an investigation by local authorities.

Upon receiving complaints, the Pune Railway Police initiated a probe into the matter. They quickly traced the fraudulent messages back to the former cricketer, who was subsequently apprehended. The police found that he had been using various online platforms to send these deceptive messages, exploiting the trust of passengers who relied on the authenticity of ticket confirmations.

This incident underscores the ongoing challenges faced by the railway system in combating ticket fraud. With the increasing reliance on digital communication for ticket bookings and confirmations, scammers have found new avenues to exploit unsuspecting travelers. The former Ranji player’s actions not only undermined the integrity of the ticketing system but also put many passengers in difficult situations, potentially leading to missed trains and financial losses.

Legal consequences await the arrested individual, as he faces charges related to fraud and deception. Authorities are likely to pursue stringent penalties to serve as a deterrent against similar fraudulent activities in the future. The case has sparked discussions about the need for enhanced security measures within the railway ticketing system, including better verification processes for ticket confirmations.

In response to this incident, railway authorities are urging passengers to remain vigilant and verify their ticket confirmations through official channels. Travelers are advised to check their bookings directly on the Indian Railways website or through authorized apps to avoid falling victim to scams. Additionally, the railway police are working on increasing awareness among passengers about the potential risks associated with ticket fraud.

This case serves as a reminder of the importance of safeguarding personal information and being cautious when receiving messages related to travel. As technology continues to evolve, so do the tactics employed by fraudsters, making it essential for individuals to stay informed and vigilant.

The former Ranji player’s arrest has also drawn attention to the broader issue of accountability within the sports community. While many athletes are celebrated for their achievements, instances like this highlight the potential for individuals to misuse their status and knowledge for illicit purposes.

The Rohit Sharma-led squad, its support staff, some BCCI officials, and the players' families have been stranded here for the past two days due to hurricane Beryl. The team won the title on Saturday after defeating South Africa by seven runs in the final.

The contingent is expected to leave Bridgetown at 6pm (local time) and land in Delhi on Wednesday at 7.45pm (IST), according to a source. The players will be later felicitated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi but the schedule of that event has not yet been finalised.

Earlier, Mottley gave an update on the situation here.

""I don't want to speak in advance of it, but I've literally been in touch with the airport personnel and they're doing their last checks now and we want to resume to normal operations as a matter of urgency,"" Mottley, who has been overseeing relief operations on the ground, told PTI.

""There are a number of people who were due to leave yet last night late or today or tomorrow morning. And we want to make sure that we can facilitate those persons, so I would anticipate that within the next six to 12 hours that the airport will be open,"" she said.

Life-threatening winds and storm lashed Barbados and nearby islands on Monday. The country, with a population of close to three lakh, has been in a lockdown since Sunday evening.

""(We have) been working to ensure that everyone is safe in Barbados, Barbadians and all of the visitors, of course, who came for cricket World Cup. We were very blessed that the storm did not come on land.

""The hurricane was 80 miles south of us, which limited, the level of damage on shore. But as you can see, we've had costal, infrastructure and costal assets have been badly damaged,"" Mottley said.

""It could have been a lot worse, but now is the time to do the recovery and the cleanup.""

The window to leave Bridgetown is a narrow one as Mottley revealed that ""we have another hurricane coming on Wednesday.""

She hoped that the Indians, who have stayed put at their hotel since winning the trophy, will be in high spirits despite the lockdown, having ended a title drought of 11 years.

""I'm sure that in spite of the passage of the hurricane, that they would have been in very, very, very good mood and spirit and to win in the manner that they won on Saturday. I think they will be floating on air for a little time,"" she quipped.

A complaint was filed against former Indian cricket team players Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina after they posted their take on the viral Tauba Tauba trend. The video showed the three cricketers grooving to Vicky Kaushal's latest song, but their awkward movements sparked a row when people accused them of mocking the disabled with their video.

The National Council for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) filed a complaint against the three veteran cricketers in the Amar Colony police station in Delhi on Monday. The complaint was filed by the executive director of the disability rights group, Arman Ali.

Explore Crickit, your go-to platform to catch the game, anytime, anywhere. Click here!
While speaking about filing a complaint against the cricketers, Arman Ali said that the video featuring Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina was “an insult to more than 10 crore disabled people of India"".

“When I saw the video of Harbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina where they were pretending like disabled, kind of mockery on a viral song, I think it's an insult to more than 10 crore disabled people of India,” news agency ANI quoted him as saying.

“Harbhajan Singh is an MP, and he should raise his voice for the disabled, but what kind of video he is making?... In India, there is an acute lack of awareness concerning disabilities. You are spreading myth and making fun of them and that's why I have filed a complaint,” Arman Ali added.

Apart from the three cricketers, the complaint also mentions Meta India's Sandhya Devanathan. The police complaint said that Instagram (owned by Meta) is violating the Information Technology Act by allowing such content to be posted online.

The former cricketers shared the video on Instagram after India Champions beat Pakistan Champions by five wickets in the World Championship of Legends final. In the video, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Raina are seen limping and holding their backs to show the physical toll taken by the matches on their bodies.


""Body ki Tauba Tauba ho Gayi in 15 days legends cricket... Every part of the body is sore. Straight competition to our brothers @vickykaushal09 @karanaujla our version of Tauba Tauba dance. What a SONG,"" the caption of the video read.

Social media users and disability rights groups found the video to be poor taste, alleging that the cricketers are mocking people with disabilities. After taking down the video, Harbhajan Singh also issued an apology regarding the viral clip, clarifying that it was not meant to hurt sentiments of the disabled.

“Just wanted to clear to our people who are complaining about our recent videos of Tauba Tauba on social media after winning the championship here in England. We didn't want to hurt anyone's sentiments. We respect every individual and community And this video was just to reflect to our bodies after playing continues cricket for 15days.

The Japanese delegation at the talks in Delhi was headed by Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Defence Minister Kihara Minoru. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh headed the Indian team.
“In the last decade, our relationship has assumed the form of a special strategic and global partnership. The logic of this evolution is our expanding interests and growing activities,” Jaishankar said in his televised opening remarks.
“As we both step forward into a more volatile and unpredictable world, there is a need for reliable partners with whom there are substantial convergences,” he said.
“As a result, we have consciously sought to facilitate each other’s endeavours, comprehend each other’s objectives, strengthen each other’s positions and work with other nations of shared comfort,” he added.
The external affairs minister said the strategic partnership between India and Japan will continue to grow as “we embrace mutuality and display sensitivity”.
“Our cooperation is today set against a larger context of a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific. For India, this is a natural extrapolation from our Act East policy,” he said.
Jaishankar emphasised that the “2+2” dialogue must particularly focus on the steps ahead.
“It has been two years since we last met in Tokyo. There have been many developments of consequence in the world. Our own relationship also has to factor in changes in our own capabilities and calculations,” he said.
In his remarks, Singh said the India-Japan special strategic and global partnership is based on democratic values and the rule of law.
He said India has set a goal of becoming a developed country by 2047 and building domestic defence capabilities is one of the significant aspects of this vision.
“The India-Japan partnership in the defence sector will be an important aspect to realise our goal. Let us make a vision for this partnership,” the defence minister said.
He exuded confidence that the discussions will lead to make a stronger commitment for cooperation in the defence sector.
“The India-Japan partnership in this sphere will be very important considering the current global situation. I think this partnership is crucial to ensure freedom, inclusivity and transparency in the Indo-Pacific,” Singh said.
Jaishankar and Singh held separate bilateral talks with their Japanese counterparts ahead of the “2+2” dialogue.
The “2+2” dialogue with Japan was initiated to further deepen bilateral security and defence cooperation and bring greater depth to the special strategic and global partnership between the two countries.
India has the “2+2” ministerial format of dialogue with very few countries, including the United States, Australia and Russia. (PTI)","India and Japan held a ""2+2"" dialogue in New Delhi, with discussions led by External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh from India, and Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa and Defence Minister Kihara Minoru from Japan. The dialogue highlighted the strengthening of the India-Japan special strategic partnership, particularly in response to China's growing military presence in the Indo-Pacific. Jaishankar emphasized the need for reliable partnerships, while Singh focused on enhancing defence cooperation to support India's vision of becoming a developed nation by 2047.

Hence, she fled her country in a hurry amid mounting pressure from the army and protesters. Sheikh Hasina is currently taking refuge in India after her ouster from Bangladesh.

After her ouster, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy said that his mother would not be returning to politics as she is deeply disappointed with the rebellion against her leadership, despite her significant contributions to the nation, according to a report by Dhaka Tribune.

But now, a close aide of Sheikh Hasina told Times Now that she had assured them that she would return soon. ""Don't lose hope. I will return soon. I have lost but the people of Bangladesh have won, the people for whom my father, my family died,"" she said in her undelivered speech before leaving for India.
Meanwhile, Hasina also accused the US of playing a hand in her ouster. ""I resigned so that I did not have to see the procession of dead bodies. They wanted to come to power over the dead bodies of students, but I did not allow it. I resigned from premiership. I could have remained in power if I had surrendered the sovereignty of Saint Martin Island and allowed America to hold sway over the Bay of Bengal,"" her undelivered speech says.","Before fleeing Bangladesh amid intense protests, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had promised to return to the country, despite her abrupt resignation and departure.

The Telegraph,2024-06-30 00:00:00,It’s raining reels on Instagram as the monsoon rushes in,"The showers tiptoed in, from the middle of June, bringing relief to several parts of India. The skies turned grey and the pitter-patter sound of the rain brought aural solace. Rain has always been romanticised in songs and literature. It has been the muse for writers for ages. Now, in this digital world, where form of expression is also through short videos, rain is once again one of the most-loved topics. For this edition of the Reels of the week, My Kolkata picks some Instagram reels that beautifully portrays the monsoons.

Monsoon nights in Kolkata
From a pluviophile's perspective, rainy nights seem almost surreal. While the murk and puddles might irk many, if you have a soft corner for the monsoon, you might overlook the cons. In this reel, photographer and videographer @behaya_ portrays the beauty of Kolkata on a rainy night. The glowing Victoria Memorial against the gloomy sky, watching the drizzle under a streetlamp and observing each drop mingle into the river Hooghly — everything in this reel brings peace to the heart. The City of Joy, drenched in rain, is a different emotion altogether.Monsoon in Darjeeling
Rain in the hills always feels like a love story. The Queen of the Hills, Darjeeling, transforms into a love-stricken beauty. The mist is everywhere and the greenery is soothing. One can spend hours watching the clouds pass by and sometimes, if you are lucky, the Kanchenjunga peeps in. In a reel montage, photographer @the_uncaptured_one captures the beauty of the hills during the peak of monsoon. If you have never witnessed this beauty, this is your cue to plan a monsoon getaway to the hills. Relax, sit back and watch the wonder of nature while you sip on your coffee or brandy and savour steaming hot momos.Monsoon in Santiniketan
If the hills feel a little too adventurous during the monsoon, you can always opt for the plains. Santiniketan, too, has its fair share of natural beauty during the months of June-August.

Hindustan Times,2024-12-31 00:00:00,"Bengaluru techie's AI startups fail after quitting ₹1 crore Amazon job: ‘2025, please be kind’","A Bengaluru-based techie has opened up about the setbacks he faced in his entrepreneurial journey after quitting his high-paying Amazon job.A Bengaluru-based techie has opened up about the setbacks he faced in his entrepreneurial journey after quitting his high-paying Amazon job. Shakti Mani Tripathi currently serves as co-founder and CTO of Reflecc, an AI agent to automate business and operational workflows of organisations. However, the journey from employee to entrepreneur was not an easy one for Tripathi, who recounted his setbacks in a now-viral X post.Quit job to launch startup
Reflecting on his “wild” year on the social media platform X, Tripathi said he quit his Amazon job with a ₹1 crore package to launch his own startup. According to his LinkedIn profile, he worked as a software engineer with Amazon and helped develop the Amazon Pay Later application.“2024 has been a wild year for me. Left my ₹1 crore job at Amazon without any backup, out of an urge to finally 'start up',” he revealed.

After quitting his job without a backup, Tripathi founded his first startup, called Hoobahoo AI, in 2024. The startup idea was rejected by Y Combinator. He pitched it to over 30 venture capitalists but failed to raise funds. He finally cut his losses and shut down Hoobahoo AI due to high customer acquisition costs and lack of funds.A series of setbacks
Next, Tripathi and his co-founder Kunal Ranjan started working on a “B2B SaaS for engineering teams to monitor engineering productivity metrics.”

This idea was abandoned after the duo realised that one cannot measure the productivity of a software engineer as there is “too much qualitative nuance.”Tripathi then worked on Codermon AI: an AI Agent for developers’ ad-hoc tasks. “Pivoted due to an overcrowded market,” he said.After these multiple setbacks, he and his co-founder decided to explore the supply chain industry to develop an AI agent for procurement. Unfortunately, this too proved to be a dead end for them as they realised they lacked prior work experience in this domain.

Tripathi then started working on Reflecc AI and developed the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) in just seven days and then conducted interviews with over 50 prospects and industry thought leaders to validate the idea.

Their efforts paid off to some extent - they managed to secure three Letters of Intent (LOIs) from potential clients, indicating genuine interest in the product. They even made it to Y Combinator’s top 10% of applications, but still got rejected in the end.Upon further reflection, Tripathi and co realised that Reflecc AI was trying to solve too many problems at once by taking a horizontal approach. Recognising the need for focus, they decided to pivot once again.

They are currently building an AI Digital Marketer.

In his post, the Bengaluru techie admitted that he had failed a lot but said that he also learned a lot from these various setbacks. “I hope 2025 doesn’t force me to quit my entrepreneurial journey and return to being an employee...once again,” he concluded.

Earlier the maximum punishment provided for those found guilty of marrying a woman by deceiving her and converting her religion was 10 years with a fine of Rs 50,000.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna introduced the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2024 in the House on Monday. P 5

It has been proposed that if a person threatens, attacks, marries or promises to marry or conspires for it, or trafficks a woman, minor or anyone with the intention of conversion, then his crime will be placed in the most serious category.


 In such cases, there is a provision of 20 years imprisonment or life imprisonment.

Under the amended provisions, now any person can register an FIR in conversion cases. Earlier, to give information or complaint about the case, the presence of the victim, her parents, or siblings was necessary.


It has been proposed that such cases will not be heard by any court below the sessions court and along with this, the bail plea will not be considered without giving an opportunity to the public prosecutor. Also, all the crimes under the amended Act have been made non-bailable.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had taken this initiative with the intention of curbing ‘love jihad’, a term coined by some Hindu outfits for alleged forcible conversion.

An ordinance was issued for curbing forced conversion in November 2020 and later, after the bill was passed by both the houses of the Uttar Pradesh Legislature, the Uttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Act-2021 came into force.","The Uttar Pradesh assembly passed the UP Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion (Amendment) Bill, 2024, increasing penalties for fraudulent or forced conversions.

The Arunachal Times,2024-07-05 00:00:00,Landslides snap surface communication in 7 dists,"Landslides triggered by rain snapped surface communication in at least seven districts of Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday, officials said.

The districts affected by landslides are Siang, East Siang, Upper Siang, West Siang, Shi-Yomi, Leparada and Upper Subansiri.

A portion of NH 13 along the Pasighat-Pangin-Aalo road was blocked following a landslide on Thursday morning. A huge boulder has completely blocked the road in between Lokpeng and Pangin trijunction in Siang district, PWD Highways Assistant Engineer Gemar Padu said.

The road is being cleared by engaging men and machinery for light motor vehicles to pass through, he said.

The Nigmoi-Aalo bypass road has also been blocked due to landslides in several locations.

Upper Siang DIPRO Y Jerang said that landslides have cut off the strategic Tuting subdivision with the rest of the district.

On 29 June, landslides completely cut off the subdivision following heavy landslides in several places at Moying and Migging villages, she said, adding that Tuting-bound commuters are stranded in Yingkiong, the district headquarters of Upper Siang.

Quoting PWD highways department official, the DIPRO said that it will take at least a week to completely restore the road if weather permits.

Meanwhile, Geku-Mariyang MLA Oni Panyang on Thursday inspected two critical highway blockage points caused by heavy rains on 30 June.

The affected areas are near Geying village and the Pongging View Point.

Noting that the damage at Geying village is substantial, the MLA said, “I have directed the PWD highway staff to prioritise this area and expedite their efforts. According to the official assessment, if the weather remains dry, the blockage can be cleared within five days.

“However, if the heavy rains persist, the resolution may take up to 10 days,” he added.

He urged travellers to “avoid non-essential travels during this period,” adding that “it is crucial to minimise risks associated with road travel under these conditions.”

Incessant rain has disrupted water supply to Aalo in West Siang district, and water supply to Likabali township in Lower Siang district has also suffered extensive damages due to floods and landslides, officials said.

Our Changlang correspondent adds: Vijaynagar valley in Changlang district remains cut off due to landslides and road blockages at various points of the Miao-Vijaynagar [MV] road due to weeklong incessant rain. The 157-km MV road was officially declared open for commuters in 2022.

Several huge trees have been uprooted and massive rocks have rolled down with the slides and blocked the road at 16, 23 and 27 Miles. In two locations, the road has not only been damaged but completely eroded to the steep.

Vijaynagar-based NC Public School Managing Director Utsav Pao informed this correspondent that “the present status of MV road is very pathetic and the chances of early restoration seem remote.”

“Many residents of Vijaynagar are stranded in Miao town as vehicles have stopped plying to the valley,” he said, and appealed to the state government and the department concerned to initiate prompt action for restoration of the road.

Prominent public leader of Gandhigram, Chizuni Yobin, informed that “there are landslides and blockages in multiple locations, including the road stretch between Hazolo and Vijaynagar.”

“The road remains cut off due to massive erosion,and is continuously shrinking in two locations,” Yobin said.

“Vijaynagar valley is running short of food items and other essential commodities,” he said, and demanded “chopper service to lift people in medical exigencies.”

Informing that the ration card holders of Vijaynagar area have not received their share of CPO rice for the last two months, Yobin demanded “sortie service for supply of rice to the valley without delay.”

It is expected that the state government, the district administration, and the department concerned will initiate prompt steps to start restoration work.","In Arunachal Pradesh, heavy rainfall has caused landslides that have disrupted communication and transportation in seven districts: Siang, East Siang, Upper Siang, West Siang, Shi-Yomi, Leparada, and Upper Subansiri.

About 15 minutes after liftoff the two small spacecraft weighing about 220 kg each were launched into a 475 km circular orbit as intended.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) successfully launched the Space Docking Experiment (SPADEX) mission on Monday (December 30).


The PSLV C60 rocket carrying two small satellites SDX01 (Chaser) and SDX02 (Target) along with 24 payloads lifted off from the first launchpad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota at 10 pm.

About 15 minutes after liftoff the two small spacecraft weighing about 220 kg each were launched into a 475 km circular orbit as intended.

“The rocket has placed the satellites in the right orbit which is into a 475 km circular orbit. The spacecraft’s solar panels have been deployed successfully. The two SPADEX satellites have moved one behind another so over a period of time it will pick up travel further distance the distance will increase by 20 km over the next few days and then the rendezvous and docking process will start. The docking process can happen in another one week; the nominal time will be approximately January 7,” said ISRO Chairman S Somanath
With the SPADEX mission, ISRO aims to exhibit technologies needed for spacecraft rendezvous, docking, and undocking using two small satellites which have been mastered by only an elite group of space faring nations.

The demonstration of this technology is essential for futuristic missions such as sending an Indian astronaut on the Moon, sample return from the Moon, the building and operation of the Indian Space Station.
ISRO said that the demonstrated precision of the PSLV vehicle will be utilised to give a small relative velocity between the Target and Chaser spacecraft at the time of separation from the launch vehicle.

“This incremental velocity will allow the Target spacecraft to build a 10-20 km inter-satellite separation with respect to the Chaser within a day. At this point, the relative velocity between the Target will be compensated using the propulsion system of the Target spacecraft,” ISRO said.

ISRO added that at the end of this drift arrest maneuver, the Target and Chaser will be in the same orbit with identical velocity but separated by about 20 km, known as Far Rendezvous.

“With a similar strategy of introducing and then compensating for a small relative velocity between the two spacecraft, the Chaser will approach the Target with progressively reduced inter-satellite distances of 5 km, 1.5 km, 500 m, 225 m, 15 m, and 3 m, ultimately leading to the docking of the two spacecraft,” it added.

Kejriwal's statement came in response to three shooting incidents that took place within a 24-hour period in Delhi. While Delhi Congress president Devendra Yadav held AAP and BJP responsible for jungle raj here.

“Law and order has collapsed in Delhi. There is complete jungle raj. People are feeling unsafe in the country's capital. Delhi's law and order comes under Amit Shah ji. He will have to take effective steps immediately,” Kejriwal wrote on X (formerly Twitter) in Hindi.

Three shooting incidents took place in Delhi within hours on Saturday , targeting a second hand luxury car show room, a hotel in Mahipalpur and a sweet shop in Nangloi. No one was injured and police suspect these shooting are linked to extortion attempts by local gangs.

Yadav said that the Capital’s law and order has become so dreadful that people live in fear of their lives and properties, but those in power seems to be least worried about the  “jungle raj” prevailing in the Capital, with former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal blaming the Lt. Governor while dummy  CM Atishi only echoes Kejriwal’s blame-games, instead of working in co-ordination with the Lt. Governor and law enforcing agencies  to protect the lives and properties of the people.

Reacting to reports of various crime incidents, AAP leader and Delhi minister Saurabh Bharadwaj said that the Delhi lieutenant governor is currently on a foreign trip, while BJP MPs are absent.

Addressing a press conference, Bharadwaj claimed that there is an atmosphere of panic in Delhi, questioning the role and priorities of Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena amidst rising law and order concerns.

 ""Delhi has 209 police stations. Why doesn't the LG visit them? Whenever there is work related to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), he goes with the commissioner, and for Public Works Department (PWD) matters, he takes the secretary along,"" Bharadwaj alleged.

 ""For Delhi Jal Board issues, he will take all three involved. He inspects the sites, makes remarks, takes photos, and claims the work was done under his direction, even though it is the Delhi government's responsibility,"" Bharadwaj added.

 ""There is an atmosphere of panic in Delhi today. I can say with full responsibility that such a situation has never existed in my Delhi before,"" Bharadwaj added, underscoring the growing concerns about public safety in the capital. Referring to a recent shooting inside a showroom in Narayana, Bharadwaj questioned, ""When will the LG visit Narayana, where bullets were fired inside a showroom? In Gulabi Bargh, Rs 3.45 crore was looted from a businessman. Will the LG visit that place? And in Mahipalpur, Goldy Brar is demanding Rs 5 crore. When will the LG address that?""

 The AAP minister further demanded that the LG take the police commissioner and the home minister with him to visit these crime scenes. In the past few days, firing incidents targeting a second-hand luxury car showroom, a hotel and a sweet shop, were reported from different corners of the city with police suspecting that these incidents are related to extortion bids by gangs.

The issue of law and order was raised in the Delhi Assembly session on Friday by ruling AAP MLAs who claimed that traders and businessmen in the city received an increased number of extortion calls from different gangs.","AAP national convener and former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal accused the capital of being under “jungle raj” following three shooting incidents within 24 hours. He urged Union Home Minister Amit Shah to take action. The shootings targeted a luxury car showroom, a hotel in Mahipalpur, and a sweet shop in Nangloi, with police suspecting links to extortion attempts by local gangs. No casualties were reported.

Delhi Congress president Devendra Yadav blamed both AAP and BJP for the lawlessness, criticizing Kejriwal for blaming the Lt. Governor and Atishi for echoing his statements instead of cooperating with authorities.

AAP minister Saurabh Bharadwaj highlighted the absence of Lieutenant Governor Vinai Kumar Saxena, who is abroad, and questioned his commitment to public safety. Bharadwaj accused Saxena of focusing only on municipal and infrastructure matters, ignoring rising crime, and called for him to personally visit crime scenes with the police commissioner and home minister.

The Delhi Assembly recently saw AAP MLAs raise concerns about increasing extortion calls to traders and businessmen amid the worsening law and order situation.",Politics,174,580

The Rohit Sharma-led side will take on Bangladesh, fresh from their historic 2-0 clean sweep against Pakistan last month, in Chennai in the opening Test before the caravan moves to Kanpur for the second and final Test of the series next week. Indian cricket team captain Rohit Sharma with teammate Ravindra Jadeja during a training session ahead of the first Test match against Bangladesh, at MA Chidambaram Stadium, in Chennai, Monday, Sept. 16, 2024(PTI)

Heading into the match, India's main concern regarding the playing XI has been their bowling combination. With Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium reportedly set to roll out a red-soil pitch, keeping in mind the preparations for the Australia tour, which will aid the pacers, India could go with a 3-2 combination. This could imply that Akash Deep, who picked up a match-winning nine-wicket haul in the Duleep Trophy earlier this month and impressed on his Test debut for India in Ranchi earlier this year against England could be picked as the third seamer.

India are predominantly set to go the 2019 way, when they had set similar pitch conditions against Bangladesh in their last home encounter as the spinners had picked just five wickets, where Ravindra Jadeja bowled only 19 overs across the two matches.

However, according to a report in PTI, captain Rohit Sharma and head coach Gautam Gambhir have decided on a 2-3 combination, implying three spinners in Ashwin, Jadeja and Kuldeep Yadav, while Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj will share workload in the pace department. Axar, who was India's hero in the T20 World Cup final, and displayed a brilliant all-round performance in the Duleep Trophy earlier this month, will have to sit out.

Rishabh Pant vs Dhruv Jurel

Jurel made an impressive Test debut earlier this year against England, which included a Player-of-the-Match-award winning show in Ranchi. However, the youngster will have to make way for Rishabh Pant in the playing XI for the opening Test against Bangladesh. The left-hander last featured in the format in December 2022, before being sidelined from cricket with a car accident.

The rest of the batting line-up requires less discussion, with Rohit opening alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal, while Shubmam Gill at No. 3, followed by Virat Kohli, would complete the top-order.

In 2024, the Nifty Bank index has risen over 8 percent year-to-date, trailing the benchmark Nifty's almost 13 percent increase. Meanwhile, over the past year, the Nifty Bank index has gained over 14 percent, compared to the Nifty's approximate 24 percent rise.

Within the banking sector, private banks have undergone a more pronounced correction compared to their public sector counterparts. Nevertheless, analysts expect a recovery for the overall banking sector in the near future.

So between blue-chip lenders and mid-cap banks, which ones should you pick for the long term?

Among banking stocks, large-cap lenders have witnessed mixed returns. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have risen 25 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively in 2024 YTD. Meanwhile, Punjab National Bank and SBI have also advanced 22 percent and 38 percent, respectively. Bank of Baroda also added over 8 percent each. However, IndusInd Bank shed over 10 percent, HDFC Bank was down 6 percent and Kotak Bank declined 5 percent in this period. 

Mid-cap banks have also given similar returns but delivered better performance than large-cap ones. Indian Overseas Bank is the top gainer, up almost 51 percent, followed by Punjab & Sind Bank, which rallied over 48 percent and Bank of Maharashtra, which jumped 46 percent.

Raj Gaikar, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities, prefers large-cap lenders over mid-cap ones.
Mid-cap lending companies are targeting underpenetrated niche segments, which are relatively riskier compared to the customer base of large-cap lenders. Given that, the market is currently overvalued and the mid-cap lender companies may face a correction, investors with low-risk tolerance should avoid investing in mid-cap lenders for now. Currently, large-cap lenders are undervalued and are likely to deliver better performance in the near future. However, investing in mid-cap lenders could help investors generate alpha over the long term.

the orissa post,2024-07-22 00:00:00,"Resentment in Kandhamal: Delay in supply of ginger, turmeric seeds to farmers","While arrangements are made by the department to identify the farmers and supply them with free seeds for cultivation of ginger and turmeric, the process has suffered a long delay this year like every other year in the past. Samson Digal of Mundanaju village under Kirikuti panchayat and Amarendra Pradhan from Karipanga village of Simanbadi panchayat have alleged inordinate delay in distribution of seeds. This has spread apprehension among the cultivators regarding a successful yield.

Furthermore, the rain has played a spoilsport for the farmers who have received the delayed seeds as too much rain during plantation may affect the cultivation of ginger and turmeric. Doubting whether they will get a good harvest, some of them are selling the seeds in the market at throwaway prices in order to earn some bucks.

While the market price of ginger is up to Rs160 per kg, the farmers are selling the ginger seeds at Rs120. Some others are taking to plantation half-heartedly after delayed arrival of the seeds.

As per sources, harvested raw turmeric is being transported out of the state from this region at the same time when the department is supplying seeds to farmers for cultivation.

It is assumed that the farmers have already completed plantation of turmeric long before the delayed distribution of seeds. Consequently, leftover turmeric and collected from the forest is being sold to the traders, who are exporting the raw spices to Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh from here.

“Awareness will be created among the farmers about proper utilisation of turmeric and ginger seeds being provided to them from the department,” said Sunil Behera, overseer of Horticulture department, in response to a query. He also warned that action will be taken against those farmers who are found to have received seeds and sold those instead of cultivating.

Regarding the delay in the distribution of seeds, he said, “After the delay of only a few days, now the seeds have been distributed for Kharif cultivation.”

It is pertinent to mention that a total of 453 quintal turmeric seeds were provided to 278 farmers in the month of May. Similarly, out of 326 quintal ginger seeds reserved to be distributed, 186 quintals has been distributed to 278 farmers in the first phase and, the distribution of 140 quintal ginger seeds to 200 farmers is underway in the second phase.","In recent developments, the distribution of free seeds for ginger and turmeric cultivation has faced significant delays, affecting farmers' confidence in a successful harvest. Samson Digal from Mundanaju village and Amarendra Pradhan from Karipanga village reported the issues, with rain further complicating the situation. The excessive rainfall during planting seasons threatens the cultivation of these spices.

Farmers, troubled by the delayed seed distribution and uncertain harvest, are selling ginger seeds below market price—Rs120 per kg compared to Rs160 per kg. Some are also planting seeds reluctantly. Concurrently, harvested raw turmeric is being exported out of the state, as the seed distribution has lagged behind.",Local News,104,389

The New Indian Express,2024-07-20 00:00:00,eSakshya: A case of the road to hell being paved with good intentions?,"An app for the collection and storage of evidence around every crime recorded in India. How modern indeed!
eSakshya, developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) with the ambitious aim of helping police record the scene of crime and the search and seizures and then upload them on to a cloud-based platform was one of the talking points when the three new criminal laws were rolled out. Many lauded the intention behind the new-age initiative in the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, that replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but there were always doubts on whether all of India could keep up.
These fears have turned out to be real, as most states are struggling to catch up more than 15 days after the implementation of the laws. And further, it has led to questions being raised about whether cases being filed without the evidence having been registered on eSakshya will hold at all.
Leading Supreme Court lawyer Nipun Saxena explained the procedure that must be followed and why the delay in getting eSakshya up and running in most states is so problematic.
""According to the new laws, in any and all cases in which an FIR is being registered, there has to be digital evidence that is recorded and stored in the app according to procedure. This recording should then be sent to the District Magistrate, Sub-divisional Magistrate or Judicial Magistrate of the first class, according to section 105 of BNSS (Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita 2023).
""As this is not being done, the chain of custody is breached, and any defence lawyer would have a field day questioning the sanctity of the submitted evidence. There is absolutely no sanctity of the evidence in cases that have been registered from July 1 till date,"" he stated.
A long list of concerns
Despite the legal framework being in place, experts say the delays are being caused as there are several challenges. The viability of the app that is designed to be a centralised, cloud-based platform for uploading and managing legal evidence and case information is also under a cloud.
First, there are the growing concerns about the country's preparedness for this digital shift.
Many legal professionals and law enforcement officers have expressed doubts about the infrastructure and training required to effectively use the eSakshya app. For instance, do police stations in India's backward villages have the necessary phones? The transition from traditional paper-based systems to a completely digitised platform requires significant investment in technology and capacity building, which many believe has not been adequately addressed.
""Our system is ill-equipped,"" said T Asaf Ali, former Director General of Prosecution in Kerala. ""No proper rules have been formulated regarding the execution of these laws, and no preparation has been done for their implementation.""
Noufal CS, SCPO (Senior Civil Police Officer) in Kerala, highlights another concern -- the app is not functional in his state.
""We have been given training and classes about the three new laws, but not much has been told about the app. We know that there is going to be a digitisation, but we do not know the exact details,"" he added.
Baiju Krishnamoorthy IPS, Kerala Cadre, said that the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) has issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to assist police officers in implementing new provisions in the criminal laws.
""Every police officer is required to upgrade his skills regarding maintaining integrity of electronic records, the task of the (cyber) expert is likely to increase with many of the mandatory provisions coming into effect,"" he said.
""DIG-level officers from the Centre were sent to the states for training,"" Krishnamoorthy added.
The new mandate has also sparked a debate about the security of uploading sensitive evidence and case details to a cloud-based platform. Cybersecurity experts have raised alarms about potential data breaches, unauthorised access, and cyber attacks on government systems.
Mukesh Choudhary, a top cyber security expert in India, says that any mobile application must be tested for vulnerabilities and routine application audits must be conducted.
Audits of the cloud infrastructure, more frequent auditing than usual with designated teams for it, adherence to the Information Security Policy are some of the suggestions he gives for a more secure and streamlined operation.
A seven-hour video and what it highlighted
But at the same time, Choudhary also voices concerns around the evidence gathering.
""A video of the crime scene and evidence collection can take a lot of time. Recently there was a case in Rajasthan where a crime scene recording went on for 7 hours. If such a video were to be uploaded on the app, imagine the amount of data and the quality of internet that is required for the same"".
Incidentally, Rajasthan is one of the states where the app has been recently launched.
Another requirement of the app is a high-speed internet.
Both Noufal and Choudhary share concerns about the difficulties this could pose. In a country like India where we have many rural areas and countless hilly terrains, getting network coverage for a normal voice call itself is sometimes difficult. How are they going to ensure internet connections that allow for long video uploads everywhere then? Who is going to pay for this? Will the government provide a reimbursement?
The video and evidence pertaining to any crime must be uploaded in the app and a designated hash value must be given. Policemen should be given training for it. But then this might be easier said than done.
An 'expert' question and confusion over grace period
According to the Indian IT Act 79A, the Centre must also provide an 'expert' for validating on electronic form evidence presented before any court or authority (Act 63 of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam).
""In this case who is the expert?"" Choudhary asked. ""Is there a certificate program that identifies this?”
In states where the app is yet to be launched, the evidence is collected according to the old Act.
Krishnamoorthy says that they are now capturing videos of everything. ""When the case comes to court, that digital evidence shall be submitted,"" he said.
When asked if they have been given any grace period till the time the app launches, he says that nothing of the sort has been explicitly mentioned. ""The deadline was June 30 before the laws came into force. There is a lot of grey area in this. We are yet to get full clarity.""","
Summary:

The introduction of the eSakshya app, developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), aimed to modernize the collection and storage of evidence in criminal cases in India. This app is part of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, which replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

is estimated to have
decreased to 8.5 per cent of
the population in 2023-24
from 21 per cent in 2011-12,
according to a new study by
economic think tank NCAER. 
The study is based on
the latest data from the India

vey (IHDS).
NCAER economists led by
Sonalde Desai have esti-
mated a decline in headcount

8.6 per cent now.
In urban areas, the pover-
ty level has decreased from
13.4 per cent to 8.4 per cent.
The decline in poverty in rural
areas has been sharper than
in urban areas.
The paper points out that
there has been a significant
increase in food subsidy
through the public distri-
bution system and other
benefits run through multiple
schemes launched by the
Centre as well as the states
which have benefitted the
poor.
This sharper decline in
poverty in rural areas was also
reflected in a recent SBI

The WHO decided to change the name of monkeypox to mpox in November of that year following racist insinuations towards some communities.According to data collected from national authorities, 99,176 cases of mpox were confirmed between January 1, 2022 and June 30, 2024, and 208 people died.

What is this virus?

The monkeypox virus is an orthopoxvirus, which is a genus of viruses that also includes the variola virus, which causes smallpox.Monkeypox is a zoonosis, a disease that is transmitted from infected animals to humans.

According to the WHO, cases occur close to tropical rainforests inhabited by animals that carry the virus. Monkeypox virus infection has been detected in squirrels, Gambian poached rats, dormice, and some species of monkeys.

Human-to-human transmission of the virus is, however, limited. It can be through contact with bodily fluids, lesions on the skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth or by virus-contaminated objects, such as bedding and clothing.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC, the infection was first discovered in 1958. Two outbreaks of a pox-like disease were recorded in colonies of monkeys kept for research — which led to the name ‘monkeypox’.","The mpox (formerly monkeypox) outbreak, affecting over 115 countries, was declared a global health emergency by the WHO on August 14, 2024. The outbreak, which began in 2022, has been particularly severe in the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring countries. With 99,176 cases and 208 deaths reported by mid-2024, mpox is caused by an orthopoxvirus related to smallpox. It is a zoonotic disease, transmitted from animals to humans, primarily in regions near tropical rainforests. Human transmission occurs through contact with bodily fluids, lesions, respiratory droplets, or contaminated objects.

The caller reported heavy blood loss due to a critical injury to the 51-year-old Chinese mariner and requested immediate evacuation, reported news agency ANI.In response to the medical emergency, a Seaking helicopter flew from Indian Naval Air Station INS Shikra at 0550 hrs. Despite adverse conditions, the Indian Navy personnel successfully airlifted the injured mariner from the bridge wing of the vessel.

The injured Chinese mariner was then transported back to the air station by an Indian Navy helicopter and subsequently shifted to a hospital for further medical treatment.The official handle of the Spokesperson of the Indian Navy on X posted video and pictures of the evacuation operation.

""Challenging weather conditions with winds over 45 knots & heavy rolling of the ship were compounded by non-availability of the continuous deck. The patient was successfully airlifted from the bridge wing of the vessel & transported back to the air station and subsequently shifted to hospital for further medical management,"" wrote SpokespersonNavy.


The Indian Navy shared that ICGS Samrat in the area was also diverted to render assistance. ""The safe & timely evacuation of the patient was a result of #jointoperation coordinated by MRCC (MBI) with #IndianNavy,"" said SpokespersonNavy.

","The Bombay High Court on Wednesday quashed a case against two men accused of hurting religious sentiments through WhatsApp messages, emphasizing that people have become more sensitive about religion nowadays and should avoid knee-jerk reactions.

A division bench of Justices Vibha Kankanwadi and Vrushali Joshi observed that as WhatsApp messages are encrypted and cannot be accessed by a third person, it is important to assess whether these messages could actually outrage religious feelings as defined under the Indian Penal Code. The court highlighted that India is a secular and democratic country where everyone should respect others' religions and castes, but also advised against immediate overreactions.

The case involved a 2017 FIR filed by Shahbaz Siddiqui, who accused armyman Pramod Shendre and medical practitioner Subhash Waghe of posting offensive messages against the Muslim community in a WhatsApp group. The accused allegedly made derogatory remarks about Prophet Mohammad and suggested that those refusing to chant ""Vande Mataram"" should move to Pakistan.

The court quashed the FIR and chargesheet, stating that the end-to-end encryption of WhatsApp messages means they could not have been seen by anyone outside the group. The bench noted that proving a deliberate and malicious intent to outrage religious feelings is necessary for such charges. The court reiterated the need for mutual respect in a democratic secular country, urging people not to react immediately if someone claims their religion is supreme.",National News,231,356

Ashwin wrecks Bangladesh as India win big in Chennai

Chasing a mammoth victory target of 515, Bangladesh were all out for 234 with only skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto offering some resistance with the bat.Local star Ashwin was pick of the Indian bowlers, while his spin partner Ravindra Jadeja provided able support as the home side triumphed inside four days.

India captain Rohit Sharma heaped praise on his bowling attack for making the most of a red-soil pitch, which assisted both seamers and spinners.

""No matter what the conditions are, whether we play in India or outside, we want to build the team around that,"" he said.

""In the last few years, wherever we have travelled, wherever we played, we managed to have that in our armoury - whether it is seam bowling options or spin bowling options.""


After Bangladesh resumed on 158-4, Shanto and all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan kept India at bay with their dogged resistance in the opening hour.

Home captain Rohit Sharma pressed Ashwin into service and he responded by breaking the partnership in his first over of the day.

The wily off-spinner lured Shakib forward and Yashasvi Jaiswal took a bat-pad catch at short leg to end the batter's knock of 25.

Jadeja had Litton Das caught in the slip and the match was effectively over when Shanto's wild swing against the left-arm spinner led to his dismissal.

Once their captain had left, a rudderless Bangladesh collapsed in a heap to lose the match with five sessions to spare.


Ashwin, who smashed a match-defining hundred in India's first innings, bagged player-of-the-match award.

Shanto said they wanted to extend the match despite being left with a mountain to climb in the contest.

""Just tried to bat as long as we can, we were not thinking about outcome,"" he said.

""Just try to follow our process and play with our strength. That's what we try to do.""

The Bangladesh captain was pleased with his bowlers and said the batters must contribute more in the second and final test beginning in Kanpur on Friday.

""The bowlers did a great job. I hope the batters will do something special in next test match.""","Ravichandran Ashwin led India to a commanding 280-run victory over Bangladesh in the opening Test in Chennai, taking six wickets for 88 runs. Chasing a daunting target of 515, Bangladesh was all out for 234, with only skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto providing notable resistance. Ashwin's performance was complemented by Ravindra Jadeja, who also contributed significantly with the ball.

India captain Rohit Sharma praised the bowling attack for capitalizing on the conditions, emphasizing their adaptability. After Bangladesh resumed at 158-4, Ashwin quickly broke their resistance by dismissing Shakib Al Hasan, leading to a swift collapse of the batting order. Ashwin, who also scored a crucial century in India's first innings, was named Player of the Match.

Shanto acknowledged the need for improvement from the batting side ahead of the second Test, which begins in Kanpur on Friday.

The Indian Express ,2024-09-01 00:00:00,"Against All Odds: With over 50 successful decoy operations, this woman’s fight against female foeticide has become her calling in life","Varsha Deshpande founded Dalit Mahila Vikas Mandal in 1990 and started to address the issues of skewed sex ratio and property rights of women.
In the 1980s, ‘Mulgi Jhali ho’ (A Girl is Born) by Jyoti Mhapsekar of Stree Mukti Sangathan became a groundbreaking play highlighting the secondary status of women. Varsha Deshpande, then a college student, was drawn to the theatre. She got involved in performing the play and taking it from one rural area to another.

“The drama’s foundation was feminist thought. It really makes us all contemplate why no one wants a girl child”, said Deshpande, who has since then been a proponent of feminist thought in letter, spirit and actions in her life, against all odds.

It started small. Once she graduated, Deshpande started a small library called ‘Pratishabda’, to bring together collections of literature written by women and about them. She spent her days writing to authors requesting complimentary copies.

It was a time in Deshpande’s life when friends were getting married, breaking up, and finding their calling, but they indefinitely felt hopeless about finding a man who would treat them as equals.
One day, Deshpande and her friends read an advertisement that astonished them. It was by a man looking for a bride who said he had no caste or religious criterion and would not demand dowry. “We all wrote a letter congratulating him on going against the tide,” recollected Deshpande.
As months flew by, Deshpande and that man, Sanjiv Bonde, became pen pals, which led to love, and the two decided to get married. “But he was born in another caste and my family was not supportive of my marrying anyone other than a Brahmin. My mom suggested that I elope. But I fought and stayed, emphasising that I was not doing anything wrong,” said Deshpande.

“It was the first inter-caste marriage in our family, but it broke all barriers, and after me, many have married into families that not only come from a different caste but religion and region as well,” Deshpande said proudly.

Having married Sanjiv, she found a partner who understood her thoughts and will to fight for change and readily supported it. She said, “People lose their independence after they get married, I gained mine.”

After marriage, Deshpande moved from her birthplace, Belgaum, to Satara. “It was a new place, I had to create an identity, figure out who I am. But it was also very exciting because I was relocating to a place where important leaders of social movements like Lakshman Mane, Dabholkar and others stayed,” she said.

To begin with, Deshpande started working as an English teacher in a local school and pursued law. She started talking to people and understanding issues related to women’s rights plaguing the place.

Deshpande then founded Dalit Mahila Vikas Mandal (DMVM) in 1990 to address the issues of women deserted by their husbands. It conducted a survey to identify women whose families had deserted them in Satara city. After that, they met with the collector and demanded that such women be issued separate ration cards. They also provided livelihood skills.
The project was then expanded to the entire Satara district, and around 5,000 women who had been deserted by their husbands and families were identified and registered.

Decoy operations to stop female foeticide

The more Deshpande worked with these women, the more she realised that skewed sex ratio and property rights were the key areas where work was needed immediately.

“In 2001, the shocking sex ratio revealed by the census report made us realise the need for advocacy for the unborn child,” Deshpande said.

She and her team started conducting decoy operations to catch doctors revealing the sex of a fetus red-handed. To date, Deshpande has conducted more than 50 such decoy operations and has cases pending in various courts across Maharashtra and Gujarat.

Recollecting memories of her first decoy operation in Satara, Deshpande said, “We used a handycam. For such cases, there is a whole outer layer of the network through which one reaches a doctor; it is an organised community, like spahi or other workers. So, we found the doctor through a seven-month pregnant woman; everything was well-recorded, and it got published in the newspapers. Soon, the doctor gave it to us in writing that what he did was wrong,” said Deshpande.
However, work like this comes with numerous challenges, like lack of support from the government, lack of protection for social workers, and victims becoming hostile. In one of the cases, Deshpande says, the star witness got hostile, her husband was abducted, and then the family was offered a lump sum of money and houses, and the cases hit a dead end.

“Whenever we get leads, we ask authorities to get involved. But they don’t. There is no protection for social activists like us. Even when we get a crime on record and catch people red-handed, they are acquitted within some years. In India, everyone makes a hue and cry about arrests but not convictions”, said Deshpande.

Deshpande said the work had now become even more difficult as doctors have changed their modus operandi and now they issue a fake congenital anomaly report, after which abortion can be done easily.

Deshpande also started working on property rights under the Laksmi Mukti initiative for co-ownership of agricultural land. “A girl child being unwanted boils down to two things—dowry and property rights. Unless and until women own assets, things are not going to change; patriarchy is not going anywhere,” said Deshpande.
So far, 1,000 farmers have come forward to sign documents for co-ownership of agricultural land. “There has to be a transformation in the way assets are owned. That’s the only way democracy will find a place in our families.”","Varsha Deshpande, a proponent of feminist thought, founded Dalit Mahila Vikas Mandal (DMVM) in 1990 to address women's rights issues, particularly focusing on deserted women, skewed sex ratios, and property rights. Inspired by feminist theater in the 1980s, Deshpande's activism began with a small library and expanded to decoy operations to expose doctors involved in female foeticide. Despite challenges, including lack of government support and hostile witnesses, Deshpande has conducted over 50 such operations. She also launched the Laksmi Mukti initiative for co-ownership of agricultural land, recognizing the importance of women owning assets to challenge patriarchy and promote equality.",Human Interest,99,960

The order was passed on September 10 by a bench consisting of Justice M Nagaprasanna. The court also quashed the case against the two students.

In this case, a probationary police officer had registered a complaint for ganja consumption against two students in the jurisdiction area of Bengaluru’s Varthur Police Station. Their blood sample results from the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) did not indicate the presence of any ganja. However, a charge sheet was still filed against the accused, after which they had approached the High Court.

The counsel for the two students argued that despite the FSL report, a chargesheet had been filed stating that the blood sample contained ganja. He argued that the duo had been deliberately framed and because of this had lost many employment opportunities. Further, they were unable to travel despite offers from the USA due to this case.

The government counsel, while accepting the discrepancy, stated that as per the panchnama, 15 gram of ganja had been seized although it was not sent to the FSL, which was an offence under a different provision of the NDPS Act than the one which was applied here (consumption).

On the other hand, the counsel of the students argued that this panchnama had been deliberately drawn up in such a manner. While the Section 50 of the NDPS Act states that the search had to be done before a magistrate or gazetted officer, the same was not followed, the counsel added.

The bench stated, “The undisputed fact in the case at hand is that, the alleged grams of ganja found in possession of the petitioners was not sent to FSL and the seizure is not recorded before a Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate as is necessary in law… Where the sample is, is a mystery. What happened to 15 grams of ganja is nowhere indicated. After the seizure, it is neither reported nor an inventory is drawn nor the sample is sent to FSL. 15 grams of ganja is not that of a high quantity for it not to be sent to FSL. Therefore, the presence of 15 grams of ganja as drawn in the panchanama is a canard and shrouded with improbability and to be disbelieved.”

Observing that the complaining police officer was not a witness in this case, the bench said, “There are illegalities whole hog that have pervaded in the proceedings….the career of the petitioners is put to jeopardy….The Station House Officer or the Investigating Officer/..complainant and the officer who drew mahazar cannot be left off the hook for having played with the lives of these young students. Therefore, I deem it appropriate to direct the Disciplinary Authority of these petitioners to initiate a departmental enquiry for having filed a false charge sheet, against these petitioners.”

Meanwhile, protesting Pujaris outside the Pracheen Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place have demanded that former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal should clarify why no financial support was provided under the government schemes in the last 10 years.

""Today I visited Marghat Baba's temple (ISBT) and launched the Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana. Today is the birthday of the Mahant ji here. I also celebrated his birthday with him,"" he said in a post on X. The ceremony began with the AAP Supremo, along with his wife Sunita Kejriwal, performing ‘Darshan Poojan’, taking blessings of Lord Hanuman, and registering temple Mahants on Tuesday.

Kejriwal also addressed the BJP criticism saying the BJP members have been criticising him since the scheme's announcement and questioned whether the country would benefit from such criticism. Kejriwal pointed out that the BJP holds power in 20 states and has been in control of Gujarat for 30 years and asked why the party had not shown respect for priests and granthis in those states during that time. He further emphasised that his Government had set an example by implementing the scheme in Delhi and suggested that the BJP should replicate the initiative in its States instead of criticising him.

""BJP people have been abusing me since yesterday, ever since the Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana was announced. My question to them is, will the country benefit from abusing me? You have governments in 20 states. You have been in power in Gujarat for 30 years. Why haven't you respected the priests and granthis there till now? Come on, do it now? I have shown the way to everyone. Instead of abusing me, why don't you implement it in your 20 states, then everyone will benefit? Why do you abuse me?"" the AAP National Convenor said on X.

Delhi Chief Minister Atishi visited Gurudwara Sahib in Karol Bagh, registering Granthis who pray for a landslide victory for the Same Aadmi Party (AAP). During her visit, Atishi offered prayers at Sant Sujan Singh Maharaj Gurudwara in central Delhi.

She added, “During registration, granthis blessed Arvind Kejriwal and me, saying this is the first time since Maharaja Ranjit Singh that a government has thought of granthis.

Pujaris and granthis are with us through life’s joys and sorrows. It is the government’s duty to care for them, which is why this scheme was launched.

Kejriwal earlier on Monday said all the Hindu temple priests and granthis of Gurudwaras will be paid a monthly honorarium of Rs 18,000 under the Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana. As the politics over the honorarium gathered momentum in Delhi, a group of priests staged a protest against Kejriwal outside the Connaught Place temple for announcing the honorarium after a delay of 10 years.","Arvind Kejriwal, leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), launched the Pujari Granthi Samman Yojana in Delhi on Tuesday, despite protests from a group of priests outside the Pracheen Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place.

Kejriwal registered the priest of Marghat Wale Baba temple near Kashmiri Gate, while Delhi Chief Minister Atishi registered the Granthis of a Gurudwara in Karol Bagh. 

The protesting priests demanded clarification from Kejriwal on why no financial support was offered to them under government schemes in the past 10 years. In response, Kejriwal criticized the BJP, which governs multiple states, for not addressing the needs of priests and Granthis in their own regions. He urged the BJP to implement similar schemes in its states instead of criticizing his government's efforts in Delhi. Atishi, during her visit to a Gurudwara, emphasized the importance of caring for priests and Granthis, acknowledging their role in the lives of people during both joyful and difficult times.",Politics,173,509
hindustan times,2024-07-16 00:00:00,Donald Trump picks JD Vance as the Republican vice presidential candidate,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump chose Senator JD Vance as his running mate for the US presidential election 2024.
Milwaukee: Donald J Trump, the official Republican nominee for the presidency, picked 39-year old JD Vance, a first-time Senator from Ohio and a critic turned admirer of the former president, as his running mate for the 2024 elections on Monday.

In a post on Truth Social on the first day of the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Trump said that after “lengthy deliberation and thought”, and considering the talent of others in the party, he had decided that Vance was best suited to become vice president.

Effectively plan, execute, and oversee projects with IIT Delhi's Project Management Programme Download FREE Brochure
Vance’s wife, Usha Chilukuri Vance, is of Indian-origin and grew up in San Diego. They met at Yale Law School and have three children. Both walked on to the convention floor on Monday evening and were greeted with cheer and applause.

Vance shot to fame as the author of Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, widely hailed as among the best books that captured, through an intensely personal chronicle, the story of the poor White working class in middle America who formed the core of Trump’s support base in 2016 and their struggle with social and economic dislocation.

He was then a critic of Trump, but embraced the leader subsequently. Vance also became the most ardent champion and among the effective spokespersons of Trump’s worldview — on trade, immigration and foreign policy — and has now become a mentor and supporter of a younger generation of national conservatives who espouse an “America first” vision.

If elected, Vance will be the third youngest vice president in American history. In 1857, John Breckinridge became VP at the age of 36, and in 1953, Richard Nixon got elected as Dwight Eisenhower when he was 40 years and 11 days old. Vance’s age introduces a new dimension in a race that has been marked by concerns around the age of President Joe Biden who is 81. Trump himself is 78, and if he wins, Vance will become the frontrunner to take on the leadership of the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement that is today synonymous with the Republican Party.

In his post, Trump outlined all of Vance’s qualifications - service in the Marine Corps, a graduate from Ohio State University in two years, a Yale Law School Graduate where he was Editor of The Yale Law Journal, and President of the Yale Law Veterans Association, a “successful business career in technology and finance”. Trump also referred to Hillbilly Elegy as a book that championed “the hardworking men and women” of US.

“J.D…will be strongly focused on the people he fought so brilliantly for, the American Workers and Farmers in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Minnesota, and far beyond..”, Trump said. He added that as VP, Vance will continue to fight for the Constitution, stand with American troops, and “do everything he can to help me MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN”.


Vance is also particularly close to Trump’s son Donald Trump junior who had consistently advocated for his selection. Trump’s nomination has resulted in one of the most ideologically extreme but cohesive conservative tickets since the Republican Party dropped its older internationalist, free market and free trade orientation and shifted towards a narrower conception of American engagement in the world and prioritised the imperatives of domestic manufacturing and creating jobs.

Kip Christianson, a 33-year old Republican delegate from Minesota at the convention, hailed Trump’s pick. “I feel he is someone who understands me. He told the coastal elites the story of middle America. The book put him on the map. I have spent much of my life with coastal elites. But he has communicated the story of my people to them much better than I could have. People feel that Trump sees and understands us. Vance shares that and will amplify that.”

","Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, has selected Senator JD Vance of Ohio as his running mate for the 2024 election. Vance, an author and former critic of Trump who became a staunch supporter, is known for his book ""Hillbilly Elegy"" and advocacy for the working-class base of Trump's support. At 39, he would be one of the youngest vice presidents in U.S. history. Vance's nomination is seen as aligning with Trump's ""America first"" policies and has been praised for his representation of middle America's struggles.",Politics,86,675
The Arunachal Times ,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Need for policy, institutional support to protect mithun: Guv","ITANAGAR, 1 Sep: Governor KT Parnaik on Sunday emphasised the urgent need for both policy and institutional support to protect the state animal, mithun, whose population is declining.

Speaking at the second edition of Mithun Day and the inauguration of a national seminar on ‘Integrated mithun farming for enhancing farmers’ income in NE’, Parnaik highlighted that the animal has not received adequate support, likely due to its small population and localised presence.

“Lack of support has led to habitat exploitation and destruction, posing a serious threat to its already dwindling numbers,” Parnaik said, and underscored that conservation efforts for mithun should integrate traditional practices with modern conservation techniques.

The governor proposed the development of a ‘special land use policy’ and designation of mithun conservation areas. He suggested that community mithun rearing centres be established in strategic locations to serve clusters of 2-3 villages.

He also recommended in-depth discussions with scientists, farmers, and officials to create a pilot project for mithun research and development, focusing on evolving best practices to benefit mithun farmers.

 Parnaik noted that Arunachal holds the highest mithun population among the Northeast states, accounting for 89 per cent of the global population. He expressed pride in the farmers and people of the state for nurturing such a unique animal.

The governor described the mithun as a symbol of peace and communal harmony, frequently featured in tribal mythology and folklore.

He further advocated domestication of mithun for draft power in plowing and as a beast of burden in hilly areas.

Parnaik suggested forming cooperatives for mithun milk and its products and establishing tanneries with modern equipment to utilise the skin and hides, which are often discarded after slaughter. These products could include high-quality coats, mats, and shoes for export, he added.

The governor exhorted the scientists and officials to evolve a technically and biologically sound breeding policy to avoid inbreeding and reduce mortality and establish research centres to exploit the productive inbuilt potential of milk, meat and draught.

The seminar was organised by the Arunachal Mithun and Yak Conservation Mission, the state animal husbandry, veterinary and dairy development department, in collaboration with the National Research Centre on Mithun in Nagaland. (PTI)","Governor KT Parnaik emphasized the need for enhanced support to protect the state animal, mithun, which is facing a decline in population.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-03 00:00:00,"Name new DU college Manmohan Singh instead of Savarkar, NSUI urges PM Modi","NEW DELHI: The announcement of inaugurating a college named after right-wing ideologue VD Savarkar unleashed a political row with the Congress and its student wing, the NSUI, demanding to rename it after late Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh instead. 
With PM Narendra Modi expected to lay the foundation stone for the Savarkar College on Friday, the NSUI wrote a letter to the PM making three demands.
The demands included: “a world-class college under the University of Delhi named after Dr Manmohan Singh; a central university dedicated to his name; inclusion of his life journey — from a post-Partition student to a global icon — in academic curricula and political sphere.”
“Dr. Singh’s legacy as a scholar, economist, and public servant embodies resilience... Naming institutions after him will inspire generations,” the letter read.
The Congress pointed out that there are numerous freedom fighters in the country, and the government can choose from that pool.
Congress MP Dr Syed Naseer Hussain stated, “There were many freedom fighters who sacrificed their lives for the sovereignty and freedom of the country. Had they named the college after either one of them, it would have been a tribute to them.”
“But since the BJP has no leaders or icons, they are promoting and legitimising those who supported the British Raj,” he added.
As regards the college, it will be constructed in Roshanpura, Najafgarh, at an estimated cost of Rs 140 crore. PM Modi is scheduled to lay the foundation stone for the project, along with two other major initiatives for DU — an academic block on the eastern campus at Surajmal Vihar in east Delhi and another academic block on the western campus in Dwarka. Together, these projects represent an investment exceeding Rs 600 crore and aim to provide state-of-the-art facilities for education and research.
Meanwhile, commenting on it, the DU Vice-Chancellor Professor Yogesh Singh said, “We can’t be more proud to learn that now the University of Delhi will have campuses in all directions- North, South, East and West. The Prime Minister will be inaugurating these three projects tomorrow, and his purpose is to offer affordable and good education to all students. Through these projects, we will create new seats and new opportunities for the students.”
He further said, “The project will be completed in approximately two years, and we thank the government for providing us with funding of `600 crore for this entire project.
We have made arrangements to broadcast the footage live when the PM inaugurates the campuses.”

https://indianexpress.com/article/world/elon-musk-donald-trump-spacex-tesla-us-administration-doge-9757654/,2025-01-05 00:00:00,"As Musk gains influence, questions hover over US probes into his empire","Last month, in the waning days of the Biden administration, the SEC set a tight deadline of several days for demanding that Elon Musk pay a settlement or face civil charges relating to alleged securities violations during his $44 billion takeover of Twitter in 2022.

Musk broke the news himself in a social-media post: “Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?” he wrote, referring to SEC Chair Gary Gensler.

He added a smiley-face emoji but attached a legal letter condemning the “improperly motivated” ultimatum: “We demand to know who directed these actions—whether it was you or the White House.”

An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the incident. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The SEC is not the only investigative agency Musk has defied and accused of political harassment. The billionaire has long railed against government oversight, portraying himself as a victim of bureaucratic zealots stifling his companies’ potentially life-saving innovations.

The White House will soon be occupied by Donald Trump — whom Musk spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to help elect — rather than Joe Biden, who appointed Gensler. Trump has already named a new SEC chair to replace Gensler, who plans to resign when Trump is inaugurated.

Musk’s potential to have extraordinary clout with the new administration raises questions about the fate of federal investigations and regulatory actions affecting his business empire, of which at least 20 are ongoing, according to three sources familiar with SpaceX and Tesla operations and the companies’ interaction with the U.S. government, as well as five current and former officials who have direct knowledge of individual probes into Musk’s companies.

The inquiries include examinations of the alleged securities violations; questions over the safety of Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems; potential animal-welfare violations in Neuralink’s brain-chip experiments; and alleged pollution, hiring-discrimination and licensing problems at SpaceX.

Musk, Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink did not respond to comment requests. Before the election, Musk posted: “I have never asked for any favors, nor has he offered me any.”

A Trump-transition spokesperson called Musk a “brilliant” entrepreneur and said Trump’s administration would ensure law and order, “treating all Americans equally.”

The Musk-related cases could languish or be dropped by Trump-appointed agency and department heads, the current and former U.S. officials said.

Trump’s DOJ picks, for example, include lawyers who defended him in criminal and impeachment trials and a nominee for FBI chief whom Musk vocally supported and who has repeatedly vowed to pursue Trump’s enemies, one current and three former DOJ officials said.

Lower-level DOJ officials could also exercise prosecutorial discretion to avoid aggressively pursuing Musk companies in light of his relationship with Trump, said Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney in Detroit during the Obama administration who also worked as a federal prosecutor during the George W. Bush and Clinton administrations.  ”To the extent they want to please the boss, I think they know how to do that.”

Some legal experts downplayed the risk of political interference from Musk, noting that an investigation’s lack of progress could signal insufficient evidence.

It’s also possible that prosecutors who believe they have strong cases will push forward regardless of Musk’s role, legal experts said.

“I don’t think there’s as much risk of Musk infiltrating to influence cases,” said Robert Frenchman, a white-collar defense lawyer at Dynamis in New York. “Most prosecutors bring cases they think they can win.”

Representatives of the DOJ and all departments and agencies with pending inquiries into Musk or his companies did not comment on the probes or their ability to enforce regulations against Trump allies during his second term. The EPA and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said they would continue fulfilling their legal and regulatory responsibilities.

‘FIRST BUDDY’
Since the election, Musk has called himself Trump’s “first buddy,” frequented Trump’s Florida Mar-a-Lago club, shared Thanksgiving with the president-elect’s family and weighed in publicly on his cabinet appointments.

Trump appointed Musk to co-lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency,” a private entity advising on slashing budgets and regulations. It remains unclear what authority the role will carry.

Musk has touted his newfound influence and given specific examples of how he might use it. Before the election, Musk said he would seek to use his efficiency-czar post to advance national driverless-vehicle regulations that would almost certainly benefit Tesla and eliminate “irrational” rules such as one resulting in a pollution fine against SpaceX.

NHTSA officials have repeatedly scrutinized Tesla for nearly a decade, at times enraging Musk. During one 2016 call, he screamed profanities at regulators launching the first of several investigations into Tesla’s Autopilot driver-assistance system after a fatal crash, according to two people familiar with the matter. There are currently five ongoing and open NHTSA probes covering driver-assistance technology and other operations in Tesla vehicles.

Tesla has blamed Tesla drivers in defending itself against lawsuits and investigations over accidents involving FSD and Autopilot, saying it had warned drivers to pay attention.

A DOJ probe into whether Tesla and Musk exaggerated its vehicles’ self-driving capabilities is among those where investigators have faced challenges. Prosecutors have grappled with demonstrating that Musk and Tesla crossed a line from legal salesmanship into knowingly making false claims that misled investors and harmed consumers.  The probe had stalled before the election in part due to the legal hurdles, a person familiar with the investigation said.

Another probe, by the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan, involves the driving range of Tesla vehicles and followed a Reuters investigation that found the automaker had rigged its in-dash displays to give drivers “rosy” projections about how many miles they could drive on battery power. It was unclear how far the probe has progressed.

“To our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred,” Tesla said in quarterly SEC filings.

Reuters was the first to report some Trump auto-policy advisors have recommended killing a requirement that automakers report data on crashes involving automated-driving systems, a measure that could cripple NHTSA’s ability to investigate and regulate the emerging technology’s safety.

ROCKETS AND NASA
SpaceX already faces little regulatory scrutiny because the government has outsourced much of its space missions to Musk’s rocket-and-satellite firm, according to two former SpaceX officials and a current government official familiar with the company’s interactions with NASA, the EPA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

During a September summit, Musk labeled “insane” an EPA inquiry that resulted in SpaceX agreeing to a proposed $148,378 fine for dumping pollutants, which Musk said were actually “drinking water.”

The FAA separately in September proposed fining SpaceX $633,000 for allegedly failing to follow license requirements and not getting approval for changes during two launches in 2023.

Musk called for FAA chief Mike Whitaker to resign in September, shortly after the FAA fined SpaceX and delayed one of its launches. Whitaker said last month he would step down before Trump’s term.

The Wall Street Journal reported in October that Musk has been in regular contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Three sources familiar with SpaceX’s government interactions said any scrutiny into Musk’s contacts with a U.S. adversary would be unlikely under Trump, who has picked tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman has financed and joined two private space missions involving SpaceX.

NASA declined to comment and Isaacman and a media representative for Isaacman’s company did not respond to a request for comment.

Musk did not respond to requests for comment regarding his reported contacts with Putin. In one instance, he responded with two laughing and crying emojis to a social-media post on X suggesting that Musk critics were attempting to portray him as a Russian agent.","The SEC recently demanded Elon Musk settle alleged securities violations or face charges over his 2022 Twitter takeover. Musk criticized SEC Chair Gary Gensler and hinted at political motives. With Donald Trump returning to office, concerns grow about Musk's influence potentially stalling 20 ongoing investigations into Tesla, SpaceX, and Neuralink.

Musk faces probes into Tesla's Autopilot safety, SpaceX pollution, and reported contacts with Putin. Critics worry Trump's administration may ease regulatory scrutiny, but legal experts note strong cases could still proceed.

After the aftermath of Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh assassination in Tehran. Reports suggest that Israel’s intelligence agency, Mossad, utilised Iranian agents to carry out the operation. According to Hebrew media, members of the elite Ansar al-Mahdi unit from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) were allegedly recruited by Mossad to execute the assassination. Initial plans targeted Haniyeh during his visit for the funeral of then-Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in May, but these plans were aborted due to unforeseen complications.
Sources from Israel's Defence Minister’s office said that the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) are on high alert, prepared for potential retaliatory strikes from Iran and its allies. The IDF has reportedly fortified Israel’s southern and northern borders to thwart any retaliatory attempts from Hamas, Hezbollah, or the Houthis. Arab media have reported that the assassination has sent shockwaves through the Iranian regime. The Iran’s intelligence agency has begun a crackdown on those allegedly involved in facilitating Mossad’s operation against the high-profile Hamas leader.

In April, the Kolkata-based lender’s founder announced he would step down to take a broader strategic role at Bandhan Financial Holdings, the bank’s holding company.

Ghosh’s abrupt departure surprised many, given the bank’s board had in November last year approved extending his tenure until 2027, subject to the banking regulator’s approval.

Though no succession plan was in place, the bank has appointed Ratan Kumar Kesh interim MD & CEO for three months starting July 10. A leadership advisory firm has been appointed to search Ghosh’s successor.

In 2001, Ghosh founded Bandhan as a not-for-profit entity to provide small loans to the underprivileged and help them in their entrepreneurial journey. It became a non-banking finance company in 2006 and India’s first microfinance institution to transform into a universal bank in August 2015.
Ghosh’s tenure as the MD & CEO has not been without its share of challenges, such as the IL&FS meltdown in 2018, a devastating cyclone in 2019, and the microfinance crisis in Assam in 2020. Later it was the Covid-19 pandemic that severely dented the bank’s asset quality and increased its non-performing assets.
However, Bandhan Bank under Ghosh acquired Gruh Finance from the erstwhile HDFC in an all-stock deal, a move that reduced the lender’s share of unsecured microfinance loans.","Chandra Shekhar Ghosh, after nearly nine years as MD & CEO of Bandhan Bank, stepped down to take on a broader role at Bandhan Financial Holdings in April.

hindustantimes,2024-09-18 00:00:00,"An Instagram for kids never happened, but this may be the next best alternative","This may well be the culmination of a journey that hasn’t been easy and may still prove to not be so as time unfolds. In 2021, Meta said they were pausing the development of something they’d referenced as “Instagram Kids”, the contours of some sort of parental supervision over children who use the social media platform, remained bleak. The choice then was to build supervision tools, a journey that may have finally culminated with mandatory parental controls for kids under 16 years (and above the age of 13 years) of age. Think of it as an Instagram for teens. Meta says this will essentially be a new form of an account. (Meta)

Meta says this will essentially be a new form of an account, and all existing Instagram-ing teenagers will have to switch and abide by the new rules in play. Aside from supervision tools that’ll give parents control over who can (and who cannot) contact their child on the social network, these teen accounts will also have sensitive content control enabled at its highest setting, tagging on posts only by people they follow, a sleep mode that turns on between 10 PM and 7 AM, which will mute notifications overnight, as well as telling teens to get off the app after 60 minutes of Instagram work in a day.

The timeline for this rollout is phased, with a plan to switch all Teen Accounts within 60 days in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, with all account holders below the age of 16 years being switched to Teen Accounts in the European Union later this year. Meta also says Teen Accounts will roll out globally in January. “We’ll also bring Teen Accounts to other Meta platforms next year,” is a promise the tech giant makes.

Teen Accounts builds on a new content policy for accounts of young users on Instagram, which rolled out in January. That included active removal of certain types of content, such as self-harm, from their feeds. Mind you, some level of parental controls for Instagram profiles have been around since 2022, but many layers were optional and often required teens to opt-in for greater controls. Which teen would? Not many, to be fair.

But would this be enough, considering Meta regularly faces multi-pronged criticism—that the company prioritises money and advertising revenue over actual measures to moderate content, and no measures thus far have been enough to ensure teens’ safety on the platform? Last month, HT reported that 19 members of the US Congress wrote a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking for an explanation as to why Meta is allowing drug dealers to post ads on the company’s social media platforms, Facebook and Instagram. This followed an earlier report by the watchdog group Tech Transparency Project, which found more than 450 ads on Instagram and Facebook selling an array of pharmaceuticals and other drugs.

You may be wondering how Meta intends to find teens who may have lied about their age when setting up the profile, in an attempt to circumvent prevalent and expected content moderation and restriction measures. Age verification is one, that will be done in more layers across Meta’s services (you may not often remember how many times you’ve lied if you’ve lied; it’s a limitation of human nature). That’s not all, and there’s a whiff of artificial intelligence (AI).

“We’re also building technology to proactively find accounts belonging to teens, even if the account lists an adult birthday. This technology will allow us to proactively find these teens and place them in the same protections offered by Teen Account settings,” Meta says, in a statement. This will roll out first in the US next year.

A compelling argument for smart glasses?

On a day when tech company Snap announced their fifth generation augmented reality glasses Spectacles with a richer, more immersive display experience, Meta and EssilorLuxottica confirmed an extension to their partnership that has already seen some level of success with two generations of Ray-Ban Meta glasses, since 2019. (Something for trivia enthusiasts—the first generation launched in late 2021, was called Ray-Ban Stories, and came about before Facebook rebranded to Meta.)

It is what they say is a new long-term agreement, “under which the parties will collaborate into the next decade to develop multi-generational smart eyewear products.” The smart glasses, which particularly impressed in the $300 (around ₹25,000) second generation launched last year, have since adopted new capabilities with a broader release of Meta AI, the multimodal intelligence assistant—its toolset includes identifying and detailing what you see, a photo and video camera, as well as translations.

Meta and Ray-Ban do not officially sell smart glasses in India at this time.

No new smart glasses have been announced at this time, but considering this Meta and EssilorLuxottica partnership extension comes just ahead of the Meta Connect summit later this month, we could perhaps get a first glimpse at the third-generation smart glasses. Or maybe not."," Meta says this will essentially be a new form of an account, and all existing Instagram-ing teenagers will have to switch and abide by the new rules in play.

Indian Express,2025-01-01 00:00:00,Indian Labourers replace Palestinians in Israeli construction sector amid Gaza war,"The construction industry in Israel is undergoing a significant transformation as Indian workers gradually replace Palestinian labourers following the outbreak of the Gaza war. The Times of Israel reports that around 16,000 workers from India have joined Israel’s construction sector over the past year, part of an effort to address the labour shortage caused by the barring of Palestinian workers after Hamas’s attack on 7 October 2023.

Raju Nishad, 35, an Indian worker, spoke to The Times of Israel from a construction site in Beer Yaakov, central Israel. Wearing a safety belt and helmet, he described how air raid warnings briefly interrupt their work but do not deter them. “There’s nothing to be afraid of here,” he said, adding that once the sirens stop, they resume their tasks
The attack by Hamas led to the deaths of approximately 1,200 people and the taking of 251 hostages. In response, Israel barred tens of thousands of Palestinian workers, who had previously formed a significant portion of the construction workforce.

Samir Khosla, chairman of Dynamic Staffing Services, told The Times of Israel about his company’s role in recruiting Indian labourers for the Israeli market. “We didn’t know much about the market, and there wasn’t an incumbent workforce from India here,” he said. Khosla has brought over 3,500 workers so far and hopes to bring up to 10,000 more to meet demand.
Despite this recruitment drive, Eyal Argov of the central Bank of Israel noted that the number of Indian workers still falls short of the previous workforce figures. Before the war, 80,000 Palestinians and 26,000 foreign workers were employed in construction. Now, only about 30,000 foreign workers are available, leading to a 25% decrease in sector activity compared to pre-war levels. Argov warned that while this shortage does not immediately affect housing supply, it may cause delays in the future due to Israel’s growing population.

Many Indian workers, like Nishad and Suresh Kumar Verma, 39, are motivated by higher earnings in Israel, where they can earn three times more than in India. Verma, who works north of Tel Aviv, said, “Making money is necessary… It’s important to continue working hard for the family’s future.”The shift in the workforce highlights the long-term challenges facing Israel’s construction industry and the evolving dynamics of its labour market, The Times of Israel concludes.","The Israeli construction industry is experiencing a shift as Indian workers replace Palestinian laborers due to the Gaza war. Since October 2023, Israel barred tens of thousands of Palestinian workers, prompting the recruitment of 16,000 Indian workers. While these workers earn three times more than in India, the sector still faces a 25% activity reduction compared to pre-war levels. The labor shortage may delay future housing projects despite meeting immediate construction demands.",International News,72,386

Neeraj Chopra continued his legacy from Tokyo 2020 by winning a silver medal in the javelin throw. With a throw of 89.45 meters, Chopra delivered his second-best performance ever. However, Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem surpassed him with an Olympic record throw of 92.97 meters, clinching the gold. Despite finishing second, Chopra's silver added to his Tokyo gold, making him the fifth Indian to win two Olympic medals, joining the ranks of Norman Pritchard, Sushil Kumar, PV Sindhu, and Manu Bhaker.

HINDUSTAN TIMES,2024-09-21 00:00:00,Series against England gave me a lot of confidence at No.3: Gill,"The centurion says he was motivated to put extra value on his wicket after getting caught down the legside in the first inningsChennai: Among the several reasons Bangladesh bowlers couldn’t make any headway in the morning session, Shubman Gill’s use of feet against spin was possibly the most crucial. With the pitch flattening out and providing absolutely no help to the pacers, the onus was on Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Shakib Al Hasan to keep the scoring in check and make India bat as long as possible. That didn’t happen once Gill got a hang of the pitch and their lengths.“Initially when I used to practise, especially against spinners, I used to step down trying to rotate. It’s the same here because it’s hard for bowlers to settle on a wicket like this where the odd one is turning but not all the balls are turning,” Gill told reporters in the post-day press conference. “I practised before the series, I had certain plans, so I think I executed them. It’s about having a good defence but then also not missing out on the opportunities that you get as a batsman to be able to score runs.”Gill had begun watchfully — the first hour produced only 48 runs in 15 overs — before two sixes off Miraz got him a fifty, and the floodgates opened for India. “I see my shots, my areas. If I get a ball here, I will try to make a run in this area. If I get a ball in this area, it’s a good ball, I will try to defend it,” Gill explained his approach. “It doesn’t really matter what’s happening at the other end and obviously the team knows what the requirement is, that comes first and then you make your game plan accordingly.”Gill wasn’t in best shape last year, having not scored a hundred in a while and asked to open the batting before moving to No.3. But the home series against England where he aggregated 452 runs, including two hundreds, reinstated the belief that Gill is indeed cut out for this position. “I think the series that I had against England gave me a lot of confidence. And I felt it was a long time coming for me, especially batting at that position,” he said. “And having got out the way I got out in the first innings, I was obviously very disappointed. As a batsman, you can’t do anything about it. But it further motivated me to be able to spend a lot of time on the crease and put extra value on my wicket.”None of this would have been possible without the support of Pant who scored a belligerent hundred playing in his first Test since the car crash that kept him out for nearly two years. Starting the day on 12, Pant took the initiative to attack, giving Gill adequate time to settle into a rhythm. “I have spent a lot of time with him on and off the field and watching him score his first fifty and first hundred after his comeback gives me so much pleasure,” said Gill. “I have seen him work so hard for it when he was coming back from the injury and I think he also must be feeling really good.”

That they were relishing the partnership — 167 for the fourth wicket — was evident in the way Pant and Gill knocked their bats after every boundary. Probably too hard, Gill later revealed. “My bat is quite old actually. And he was hitting my bat so hard. I was telling him, you know, I’m trying to save my bat,” said Gill. “And if he didn’t middle it, he would say, ‘No, let’s do it again.’ And I was like bro, calm down.”

","
Shubman Gill attributed his successful innings against Bangladesh to a strategic approach against spin bowling, focusing on using his feet effectively. After initially being cautious, he found his rhythm with aggressive shots, particularly two sixes off Mehidy Hasan Miraz. Motivated by a previous dismissal in the first innings, Gill aimed to value his wicket more. He highlighted the support of Rishabh Pant, who also scored a hundred in his first Test since a long injury absence, creating a strong partnership of 167 runs. Gill expressed enjoyment in their camaraderie, even humorously noting Pant's enthusiasm during their batting collaboration.",Sports,98,630
The New Indian Express,2024-10-17 00:00:00,Escalating Israel-Iran conflict casts shadow over Kerala Tourism,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has come as a heavy blow to Kerala Tourism, which was anticipating a surge in foreign tourist arrivals this season. The UK government’s recent travel advisories against transiting through the UAE have sparked concerns among the tourism stakeholders as a majority of international tourists flying to Kerala come via UAE.

With military activity growing in the Red Sea region, the cruise tourism industry is already feeling the heat with many cruise line operators cancelling arrivals to Kerala.

Rajesh P R, a tour operator, said a lot of issues, ranging from the brewing tension between Israel and Iran to global climatic events, are casting a shadow on the upcoming tourism season.

“There are a lot of uncertainties and the airfare has slightly gone up for flights to Kerala. As of now there are no issues but the industry is very concerned as we were expecting a drastic revival in foreign tourist arrivals,” Rajesh told TNIE.

This year, the tourism department is expecting around 8 lakh foreign tourists and 2.20 crore domestic tourists. In 2023, Kerala received around 6.49 lakh foreign tourists. The top eleven countries were the USA, UK, Oman, France, Maldives, Germany, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Australia and Russia.

Confederation of Kerala Tourism Industry president E M Najeeb said if the airfare goes up exponentially, the tourism industry will naturally be affected.

“The situation continues to evolve and our season will begin in October-November. The domestic tourism hasn’t been hit and we have to wait and see how the war situation impacts the oil prices and airfare,” he said.



Given the military activity in the Red Sea, international shipping and cruise operations have taken a hit. Last year, around 42 cruise ships docked at Kochi. According to stakeholders, the cancellations this year are higher and they expect only 12 to 14 cruise ships this season.

“Several cruises have cancelled their trips because of the unsafe situation in the Red Sea. We were expecting a better season this year. It’s a huge loss for the cruise tourism industry. The cruise operators are exploring safer destinations and avoiding South Asia,” said Lijo Jose, managing director of Muziris Heritage - India Experiences, a tour operating company specialising in shore excursions for tourists.

Given the situation, the Kerala Maritime Board has initiated talks with foreign cruise operators, urging them not to avoid Kerala.

“We are in talks with foreign cruise line operators as many of them are repositioning their cruises owing to the war situation. We have urged them to find safer routes and not to avoid Kerala,” said Kerala Maritime Board chairman N S Pillai.","The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran is significantly impacting Kerala's tourism, as many foreign tourists typically transit through the UAE, which is now facing UK government travel advisories. Concerns are growing among tourism stakeholders, particularly in the cruise industry, with many cruise lines canceling trips to Kerala due to increased military activity in the Red Sea. Tour operators note that rising airfares and geopolitical tensions are casting uncertainty over the upcoming tourism season, which was expected to see a revival. The state hopes to welcome 800,000 foreign tourists this year, down from previous projections due to these challenges. The Kerala Maritime Board is in talks with cruise operators to encourage them to maintain routes to Kerala despite the ongoing conflict.",Business and Finance,121,440
Indian Express ,2024-12-30 00:00:00,"‘Virat Kohli’s foot is going straight down the pitch, not towards the ball’: Sunil Gavaskar on batter’s outside off-stump woes","Batting legend Sunil Gavaskar on Monday made a scathing assessment of seniors Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, holding them responsible for the top-order failure and India’s eventual 184-run defeat in the Boxing Day Test against Australia in Melbourne.

While a win gradually faded out from the equation, India’s batters could not apply their defensive acumen to see out the game, with Rohit and Kohli falling cheaply on single-digit scores.

Kohli, who was been found wanting for his persisting outside off-stump issues, fell for another delivery in the channel as he edged Mitchell Starc into the slip cordon. Even as he appeared to have approached the second innings with a straighter, side-on stance according to former India head coach Ravi Shastri on commentary, Kohli exhibited a noticeable flaw in the attempted drive that Gavaskar picked up on. “The (Kohli’s) foot is not going to the pitch of the ball, the foot is going straight down the pitch, not towards the ball. If the foot goes more towards the ball, you have more chances of hitting the ball from the middle,” Gavaskar told India Today. “Because the foot is not moving you end up reaching for the ball and that is what has been happening,” he observed. Gavaskar lambasted Kohli and Rohit’s no-show and affirmed that the top-order, barring Yashasvi Jaiswal, was to blame for the defeat that put the Aussies up ahead at 2-1 in the series.

Set a target of 340 on the final day of the fourth Test, the Indian batters, with the exception of Yashasvi Jaiswal (84), faltered yet again to lose the match by 184 runs and trail 1-2 in the five-match series. “It all depends on the selectors. The contributions that were expected have not come. It is the top-order which has to contribute, if the top-order is not contributing, why blame the lower-order. “The seniors have not really made the contribution that they should have, all that they had to do was bat out today and live to fight another day in Sydney,” Gavaskar added.

“…it’s just that the top-order didn’t contribute and that is the reason India found itself in this position.”

Gavaskar heaped praise for Jaiswal for his second successive 80-plus score of the match, but was left unhappy with Pant’s second dismissal off a rash stroke in the match, falling prey to the long-on fielder from a mistimed slog off Travis Head.

“The issue is this shot called sixer in cricket and which is like a drug. Once you hit a couple of sixes, then you think that’s a real a high because once you hit the ball cleanly of the middle of the bat and it goes into the stands, there is no better feeling for a batter. Sixer is a different feeling and it’s a drug, it gets into your system,” Gavaskar said.","Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar criticized Indian senior batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma for their poor performances in the Boxing Day Test against Australia, where India suffered a 184-run defeat. The loss in Melbourne put India behind 2-1 in the five-match series. Gavaskar attributed the top-order failure, excluding Yashasvi Jaiswal's impressive 84, as the primary reason for the defeat. Kohli’s recurring issue with deliveries outside the off-stump resurfaced, leading to his dismissal for a single-digit score. Gavaskar highlighted a technical flaw in Kohli’s foot movement, explaining that his front foot was not moving towards the ball, causing him to play away from the body.

Rohit Sharma, too, failed to contribute, with both seniors unable to anchor the innings or apply defensive techniques on the final day to salvage the match. Gavaskar asserted that the top-order's lack of contributions made it unfair to blame the lower order for the loss. He praised young Jaiswal for his second consecutive score over 80 in the match but criticized Rishabh Pant for his rash dismissal, likening the obsession with hitting sixes to an addictive drug that clouds judgment. Gavaskar urged selectors to reevaluate expectations from senior players ahead of the series-deciding matches.",Sports,198,473

During the numerous DIBODS search and detection runs over two days, confirmation runs were done through Boat based IBODS (Intelligent Buried Object Detection System), sonar, thermal imager, magnet lines and interpretation of the DIBODS data and ultimately four Contact Points (CP) have been identified (as shown in picture).

According to the team Contact Point (CP) 4 has exhibited signatures closest to a truck’s form and factor. “The object is likely embedded in slant formation with earth and rock deposit and cabin likely upwards with a high probability of partial damage. The presence of human form could not be ascertained with sureity due to dielectric data bank constraints. Thermal Imgaery did not reveal the presence of warm objects. This does not mean the absence of human form”, the team has said.

The mint,2024-07-13 00:00:00,"Agnipath scheme to stay, tweaks likely in the upcoming budget or later","The four-year armed forces service scheme, Agnipath, may undergo some changes in the Union Budget or subsequently to make it more attractive.

Despite opposition protests, the Union government assesses the scheme as an effective instrument in attaining the twin goals of improving the youth profile of the armed forces and addressing the issue of mounting defence pension liability, said two persons with knowledge of the thinking in the government.

Under the scheme, introduced in June 2022, men and women aged 17.5 years to 21 years are recruited below the officer rank in the three services, given optimized basic military training and specialised trade training.

The scheme then allows for the absorption of a fourth of these recruits, called Agniveers, in the permanent cadre.

“The scheme has taken off. It helps in giving the defence budget a much-needed makeover, in terms of directing more spending towards technology and weaponry and less towards human resource expenditure,” said the first person mentioned above, who spoke under the condition of anonymity.

The scheme may be modified either in the FY25 Budget or later, but it will continue, the person added
The armed forces have about three million retirees overall, many in short service commissions, leading to a shorter service period and a comparatively long pension period for many service professionals.

“The pension liability, if not addressed, could become unsustainable,” said the second person.

For FY25, the government has allocated ₹1.41 trillion for defence pension, nearly a fourth of the ₹6.2 trillion defence budget.

‘Young soldiers in the forces’
""Agniveers do a four-year duty. They get a tax-free lump sum at the end of their four-year tenure. At the end of the four years, another set of people come in. So you have young soldiers in the forces perpetually. About a quarter are permanently retained,"" the second person said.","The Indian government's Agnipath scheme, introduced in June 2022, may undergo modifications to enhance its appeal. Despite protests, the scheme is viewed as effective in rejuvenating the armed forces' youth profile and managing defence pension liabilities. It recruits individuals aged 17.5 to 21 for a four-year service, with 25% being absorbed permanently. The scheme aims to redirect defence spending towards technology and weaponry.

The Imphal Free Press,2024-07-26 00:00:00,‘Climate change possible cause of increasing dengue cases in Manipur’,"Dengue cases witnessed an increase in Manipur last year as it was recorded the highest in Manipur, while authorities are indicating an existing link with the changing climate and erratic weather patterns in the state over the past few years.  According to data issued by the Directorate of Environment and Climate Change, Porompat, Imphal East district, a rise in temperature was seen. In the last three years, a temperature of 33.94 degrees Celsius was recorded in Imphal West district, while 34.54 degrees Celsius was recorded in Imphal East district in the month of July.   In the following year, 2023, the temperature in Imphal West was recorded at 35.92 degrees Celsius, and the same temperature was recorded in Imphal East district in April.   Regarding the cases of dengue found in the two districts, a total of 503 dengue cases were detected in 2022. Among the positive cases, Imphal West recorded 63 cases, and Imphal East recorded 57 cases. In the same year, the highest number of dengue cases was recorded in Tengnoupal district with 239 positive cases.   The following year, the number of dengue cases in Imphal West district drastically increased, recording the highest number with 1,639 cases, followed by Imphal East district with 521 positive cases.   In the current year, 2024, a total of 81 dengue cases have been detected till July. The State Directorate of Health Services, in collaboration with the state Malaria Department, has been taking necessary measures to control the spread of dengue.   Dengue is a viral disease caused by the bite of a particular female mosquito named ‘Aedes aegypti’.   In an exclusive interview, the state malaria officer Dr S Priyokumar told the Imphal Free Press that the sudden rise in dengue cases could be due to various factors including unplanned urbanization, water supply mismanagement, and climate change in Manipur over the past few decades.Earlier, the disease occurred as a seasonal viral illness. However, with the rising temperatures, dengue cases are found for a longer period throughout the whole year, he added.   Responding to the IFP, he said that fogging by mixing diesel oil with ‘deltamethrin’ and spraying diluted ‘Temephos’ chemicals were practiced in vulnerable areas or at suspected mosquito breeding places to prevent the spread of the viral disease.   Mass spraying and fogging by using ‘Temephos’ chemicals were widely carried out by the people, considering that these measures would prevent the spread of the virus.   ‘Temephos’ is used to kill mosquitoes at the egg stage before they turn into adult mosquitoes. However, the massive and frequent use of this chemical as a precautionary measure can affect the environment by its chemical residue, he said.   The impact of Cyclone Remal recently affected Manipur on a large scale, causing massive flooding in various areas of the state. Priyokumar said that ‘Tangkhul Avenue’ in Imphal East district was seriously affected due to the flood.   To prevent other post-flood diseases, including dengue, local volunteers used ‘Temephos’ chemicals massively in the area. Later, with the southwesterly monsoon rain, the same place was again flooded. The same chemical was used again as a preventive measure for post-flood diseases.   While ‘Temephos’ chemicals might have minimal residue, frequent and massive use of this chemical could affect the environment of the surroundings, Priyokumar said.   He said that in the entire northeastern region, the first dengue case was detected in Manipur’s border town Moreh in 2007. He said dengue cases are usually found in hot climates, and the increasing number of dengue cases shows that the virus is becoming more suitable in the present climate of Manipur.   The director of environment and climate change, Th Brajakumar, earlier said that climate change and rising temperatures in Manipur or any place is a natural phenomenon and will be hard to control.Awareness programmes are organised on a large scale to prevent unplanned urbanization and deforestation which could accelerate the rate of climate change.   As an awareness message to the public, the department concerned uses different media platforms. Mass awareness includes preventing stagnant water in the surroundings, covering potable water in the house to prevent mosquito breeding, using insect repellent, wearing loose-fitting clothes, long-sleeved shirts and pants, and other measures.   The government, as part of initiatives to kill mosquito eggs in drains, has started using larva-eating fish in some drains instead of using chemicals.   Director of Health Services O Sanahanbi said that using chemicals or mosquito repellents affects a person’s health and indirectly affects the environment with chemical residue. No cure has been invented for dengue virus infection till date, she said.   Taking up ‘primordial prevention’ measures instead of using chemicals will be the most effective way to prevent the disease, Sanahanbi said. Primordial Prevention is a concept that precedes primary prevention and focuses on risk factor prevention.   She said that instead of using mosquito repellents, people should maintain a clean environment inside the house and surroundings. Most people, especially in urban areas, due to unplanned urbanization, are increasingly planting indoor plants.   However, they neglect to change the base plate of the vase, and some plants are even planted in water bottles or water vases as decorative items. Such stagnant clean water becomes a favorite breeding place for ‘Aedes Aegypti,’ which causes dengue infection, she added.   Instead of using chemicals and mosquito repellents, people should change the water at regular intervals. By practicing this, the environment could remain free from contamination, she added.","Dengue cases in Manipur have surged, particularly in 2023, with a notable increase linked to rising temperatures and climate change. The Imphal West district recorded the highest number of cases, escalating from 63 cases in 2022 to 1,639 in 2023. The State Directorate of Health Services is implementing measures, including fogging and spraying chemicals like ‘Temephos’ to control mosquito populations, although excessive use poses environmental risks. Officials are advocating for ""primordial prevention"" strategies over chemical reliance, emphasizing maintaining clean environments and managing stagnant water to curb mosquito breeding. Awareness campaigns are ongoing to inform the public about preventive measures against dengue.",Health and Wellness,101,893
INDIAN EXPRESS,2025-01-02 00:00:00,Pune gyms swell with new joinees as New Year dawns: key question is how many will stay put by February,"As the New Year begins, gyms in Pune are experiencing a surge in new memberships, a trend that is common across many cities as individuals set fitness resolutions for the year ahead. This influx of new joinees reflects a widespread desire to improve health and fitness, driven by the motivation that often accompanies the start of a new year. However, the key question remains: how many of these new members will maintain their commitment and continue to attend the gym by February?

The initial excitement of joining a gym can be attributed to various factors, including the desire to lose weight, build muscle, or simply adopt a healthier lifestyle. Many individuals are inspired by the prospect of a fresh start and the opportunity to make positive changes in their lives. Gyms often capitalize on this enthusiasm by offering attractive promotions, discounts, and flexible membership plans to entice new members.

However, history shows that a significant percentage of new gym members tend to drop off within the first few months. According to industry statistics, around 50% of new gym members stop attending within six months, with many losing interest by February. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors, including unrealistic expectations, lack of motivation, and the challenges of integrating a new routine into daily life.

To combat this trend, many gyms in Pune are implementing strategies to encourage retention among new members. Personal training sessions, group classes, and community-building activities are being emphasized to create a supportive environment that fosters commitment. By providing personalized attention and a sense of belonging, gyms aim to help new members stay engaged and motivated.

Additionally, gyms are increasingly utilizing technology to enhance the member experience. Fitness apps, online workout programs, and virtual classes are becoming popular tools that allow members to track their progress and stay connected with their fitness goals. These resources can help individuals maintain their motivation and accountability, making it easier to stick to their resolutions.

Moreover, the role of social support cannot be underestimated. Many new members find it beneficial to work out with friends or join group classes, as this creates a sense of camaraderie and accountability. Gyms are encouraging members to bring friends along or participate in buddy workouts, which can significantly enhance the overall experience and increase the likelihood of continued attendance.

As February approaches, gyms in Pune will be closely monitoring attendance rates and member engagement. They are likely to conduct surveys and gather feedback to understand the reasons behind drop-offs and identify areas for improvement. By addressing the challenges faced by new members, gyms can refine their offerings and create a more welcoming and motivating environment.","As the New Year begins, gyms in Pune are witnessing a significant influx of new memberships, driven by individuals eager to fulfill their fitness resolutions.

Mint,2024-12-31 00:00:00,The significance of liquid water on Mars,"THE APPLICATION of Bayesian inversion to a range of lithologic parameters in an assessment of seismic data hardly seems the stuff of headlines. But when the seismic data you are assessing come from Mars, and when your reasoning suggests that the best explanation for them is liquid water in the pores between rocks, you have a story. There is little people thirst for more, when it comes to planetary science, than water on Mars. Why does the prospect provoke such excitementand what does this new research add to the story?
Liquid water seems to be a necessity for life. And from the 19th century to the early days of the exploration of space, astronomers assumed that there was liquid water on the surface of Mars. Perhaps not muchthe notion that the planets inhabitants had built a network of canals through which water could flow from the polar ice caps to the tropics, promulgated by the American astronomer Percival Lowell from the 1890s onwards, was based on the idea that the planet was undergoing widespread desertification. But enough to support lifeif not the advanced life that Lowell was so keen on, at least the primitive forms that astronomers continued to imagine there after his fancies had been discarded.
In the 1960s the first spacecraft to get to Mars told a different storyindeed, crucially, two different stories. First, Mars had a far thinner atmosphere than had been thought, much too thin for liquid water to persist on the surface. (In low pressure water boils away, even at very low temperatures.) Second, its icecaps seemed to be composed largely of frozen carbon dioxidedry icean idea that Lowell and many of his successors had pooh-poohed.
But the spacecraft that followed in the 1970s showed that things had once been different. Erosion had carved river valleys into the planets southern highlands. There were plains which, to expert eyes, appeared to have been scoured by vast, catastrophic floods. There were what looked like shorelines, suggesting to some that the planet had had lakes and perhaps even an ocean in its low-lying northern plains. What now looked barren might once have been warmer, wetter and much more habitable. A disappointing absence became an enduring mystery: where was that water now?
A lot turned out to be frozen: beneath a thin seasonal veneer of carbon dioxide the northern polar cap is mostly water ice. There is also a lot of ice frozen into the pores within rocks near the surface, forming a cryosphere around the planet. And theres more bound up in minerals. Evidence of little trickles on the surface suggest that sometimes bits of it escape into liquid form, at least briefly. But for the most part it just sits there. If you think that Mars did not have much water to begin with, it is possible to imagine that it has all been frozen or blown away into space as the atmosphere thinned.
But what if there was once a lot of watermore than can be accounted for by that which has been lost to space or frozen. The only other place it could be hiding is deep in the planets crust. That is where Vashan Wright of the Scripps Institute of Oceanography and his colleagues think they have found it. In Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences they present an analysis of data provided by InSight, an American probe that monitored the tremblings of the planets crust from Elysium Planitia, a plain near the Martian equator, between 2018 to 2022. The researchers looked at a range of possible crustal constituents to see what arrangement would best explain that data; the fit that seemed most sensible was one in which the pores in the rock were full of liquid water from about 10km deep to around 20km. If they are right, and the area that InSight assessed is typical of the planet as a whole, such aquifers could contain more than an oceans worth of water.
To reach that water would require drills far beyond anything that the current generation of Mars robots could carry. Even on Earth it would be hard. But further geophysical research could do a lot to confirm or deny the findings. If the aquifers are there, they may provide new insights into the dynamics of Marss desiccation. And if Mars ever was the abode of life, they may be the habitat of its last survivors.

The Telegraph,2024-09-17 00:00:00,AITA questions Sumit Nagal’s absence from Davis Cup tie after he registers for ATP event,"The All India Tennis Association (AITA) on Tuesday suggested that the country's top player Sumit Nagal perhaps deliberately missed the Davis Cup tie against Sweden last week, claiming that he was injured but is now set to play an ATP tournament in China.

India were hammered 0-4 by Sweden and AITA secretary Anil Dhupar said absence of top players like Nagal and Yuki Bhambri in the squad hurt the national team's chances of doing well in the World Group I contest in Stockholm.

Skipper Rohit Rajpal fielded doubles players N Sriram Balaji in the opening singles. Ramkumar Ramanathan was the only experienced player in the squad and two of the other three -- Aryan Shah and Siddharth Vishwakarma -- were debutants.

Niki Pooancha, who is just one-tie old, also largely focusses on doubles.

So effectively, India had just one singles player.

Nagal had opted out of the tie saying that he had some back issue while Yuki did not specify why he chose not to play.

Nagal has entered the ATP250 event in Hangzhou and is drawn to meet a Qualifier in his opening round.

""Definitely if Sumit and Yuki had played, we would have had far better chances. They questioned the management of AITA, the captain and team. Sumit Nagal said he had some back problem, but (is) that problem okay (now)? He is playing a tournament in China, so somebody has to make people understand the right thing,"" Dhupar said.

Asked Mukund Sasikumar was already suspended by the AITA, Dhupar said despite that, captain Rajpal made efforts to get him on the team.

""The captain called 10 times and that he will request the executive committee to revoke the decision (suspension). It's time for you to play. If there is a decision against you, he will request the executive committee. But he refused."" After India's crushing defeat, Nagal and former players Somdev Devvarman and Purav Raja had questioned the way AITA functions.

Nagal had also questioned why AITA officials were standing in the front row while the players were in the back row ahead of the tie against Sweden.

AITA also released a statement on its twitter handle, saying that Davis Cup is more than just tennis.

""Representing India in Davis Cup is more than just tennis -- it's about honour, national pride and inspiring the next generation of athletes. Players like Sumit Nagal, Yuki Bhambri and Mukund Sasikumar refused to play for country even though they were participating in other tournaments elsewhere.

""AITA management, including the captain of the Davis Cup team, tried to convince each of them to play for country, but they simply refused,"" the tennis body said in its statement. PTI reached out to Nagal, Bhambri and Mukund but all three refused to comment.

AITA also released a list of its work, saying it conducted as many as 829 tournaments for the benefit of the players in 2023 season. It also said that it conducted several courses to develop new coaches and that 130 new coaches had registered with the sports body in the 2024 season.

Asked what point AITA was trying to make with this statement, Dhupar said, ""I'm not trying to make any point. I'm trying that there are few things we have done.

""There is one point that people should know. Number two, Davis Cup is definitely a very important. It's more than a tournament, every player who is an Indian should participate if selected. So why not? ""He (Nagal) said that he had a back injury and now he has entered this Hangzhou Open. He has become alright. My good wishes to him. Let the country decide. Let the people of India decide,"" Dhupar said.

""And it is not the first time that Mukund refused, three times before. Let the people decide, the players decide what can we do? We tried our best to bring these people on board. If they are not available, what to do?"" Dhupar said that AITA was facing ""unnecessary"" criticism for the loss against Sweden.

Northeastern India is home to approximately 21 species of venomous snakes from the families Viperidae and Elapidae. With the addition of these two species, the list moves up to 23 for the region, Abhijit Das of the WII, who was a member of the study team, informed in a release on Saturday.

He said that, out of the eight species of venomous kraits from India, Northeast India holds the maximum species diversity of five.

“Despite several fatalities by other Bungarus species, commercial antivenom is manufactured only against the most widespread congener B caeruleus. This new finding reported here also indicates the lack of systematic studies on this group of snakes, especially in northeastern India,” stated a paper published by the researchers from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, and the Natural History Museum, London,in the latest edition of the journal Threatened Taxa.

The study stated also that the actual distribution of the ground-dwelling Zayuan pit viper in Arunachal may be far larger than currently understood. Similarly, the distribution of the dangerously venomous Suzhen’s krait in Northeast India needs further investigation, the release said.

 “Therefore, proper identification of such venomous species and understanding of geographic distribution,backed up by genetic data, is crucial for general awareness, venom research, as well as development of lifesaving antivenin,” the study said.


It also emphasised the importance of recognising other medically important snakes, especially from Northeast India, for snake antivenom research and manufacture.","Two new snake species have been reported from India for the first time: Suzhen’s krait (Bungarus suzhenae) and Zayuan pit viper (Ovophis zayuensis). Suzhen’s krait was discovered on the Nagaland-Manipur border, while the Zayuan pit viper was found near the Dri River in Arunachal Pradesh. These snakes add to the 21 known venomous species in northeastern India, bringing the total to 23. The discovery highlights the need for more systematic studies and better antivenom development, as current commercial antivenom only covers a few species. The study underscores the importance of identifying and understanding the distribution of these venomous species for improved medical research and safety.",Science and Technology,105,316

Decrying the prevailing situation in the state, which has hampered the education of numerous students, All Kha Kanglei Students’ Union (AKKSU) staged a protest demonstration at Kakching Ibudhou Naohallai Lampak on Thursday, participated by many students, their parents and guardians.

Speaking to the media, AKKSU general secretary Ksh National recalled the immense challenges faced by the student community of the state owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. He lamented that the unprecedented crisis had added to the woes of the students, threatening their academic career.


He pointed out that many students have left their studies and volunteered in defending the villages against attacks. The same is due to the failure of the central forces deployed in the state to protect the people, he alleged.


He went on to say that the central forces are of no use in the state if they are unable to execute their duties, to protect the lives of the people and students. He urged the centre and state governments to adopt a policy to ensure the safety and well being of the students to build their academic career.


Taking part in the protest, Kakching Apunba Nupi lup convenor, N Kalpana resented the state government’s infamous statement ‘will take action’ pertaining to the prevailing situation.


She condemned the central forces for allegedly remaining a mute spectator to the terror attacks carried out by the kuki militants, with the latest being the recent drone attack. ‘If they are unable to safeguard the lives and properties of the innocents, make them leave Manipur’, she asserted.


She added that overstaying will instead hamper the state’s economy. Kalpana further appealed to the government to take concrete measures to resolve the prevailing crisis, considering the future of the students and upcoming youths.


Protesters also paid tributes to the victims of the conflict including mother of young student Ngangbam Rojiya, Ngangbam Surbala, who was killed in a latest drone attack by kuki narco terrorists.

The Arunachal Times ,2024-07-02 00:00:00,Arunachal reconstitutes 6 regional committees to examine status of border dispute with Assam,"ITANAGAR, 13 Jul: The Arunachal Pradesh government has reconstituted six regional committees to examine and exercise the present status of the border dispute with Assam.

A notification issued by the home and interstate border affairs department on Thursday said that the terms of reference (ToR) for the regional committees, as established, will continue to be governed by the provisions set forth in the original notification issued on 1 June, 2022.

The remaining six districts of the state where border dispute with Assam still persists as people from both states have not agreed to demarcation of villages along the interstate border includes Pakke-Kessang, Papum Pare, Kamle, Lower Siang, Lower Dibang Valley and Longding.

The state government has appointed Health Minister Biyuram Wahge as the chairman of the committee for Pakke-Kessang district, with the deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police as members.

For Papum Pare district, Land Management Minister Balo Raja has been appointed as the chairman, with Rajya Sabha MP Nabam Rebia, Doimukh MLA Nabam Vivek, and the DC and the SP as members.

While Law Minister Kento Jini has been appointed as the chairman for Lower Siang district, Commerce & Industries minister Nyato Dukam is the chairman of the Kamle district regional committee.

Rural Development Minister Ojing Tasing and Agriculture Minister Gabriel D Wangsu have been appointed as chairmen for Lower Dibang Valley and Longding district, respectively, the notification said.

On 15 July, 2022, the chief ministers of Arunachal and Assam signed an agreement to end the decades-old border issue and decided to “restrict” the number of disputed villages to 86 instead of 123.

It was called the ‘Namsai Declaration’ after the name of the place where their meeting was held.

Assam and Arunachal share an 804.1-km-long border.

Arunachal, which was made a union territory in 1972, has been maintaining that several forested tracts in the plains traditionally belonged to hill tribal chiefs and communities and these were “unilaterally” transferred to Assam earlier.

After Arunachal achieved statehood in 1987, a tripartite committee was appointed, which recommended that certain territories be transferred from Assam to Arunachal.

Assam contested this and the matter was in the Supreme Court for a long time. (PTI)","The Arunachal Pradesh government has reformed six regional committees to address ongoing border disputes with Assam. The committees will operate under terms from a June 2022 notification, focusing on Pakke-Kessang, Papum Pare, Kamle, Lower Siang, Lower Dibang Valley, and Longding districts.

DNA,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"This country plans to butcher over 700 elephants, hippos, zebras, the reason will SHOCK you","Namibia, a country in Southern Africa, is planning to butcher over 700 wild animals including elephants, hippos, and zebras. to provide meat for its 1.4 billion people who are reeling under drought, being considered worst in a century. 

According to a report by The Indian Express, a total of 723 animals, including 30 hippopotamuses, 60 buffaloes, 50 impalas, 100 blue wildebeest, 300 zebras, 83 elephants, and 100 elands, a type of antelope, are on the kill list of the Namibia government. Moreover, over 150 animals have been killed already, yeilding about 63 tonnes of meat.

In a press statement dated August 26, the country’s Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism said, “This exercise is necessary and is in line with our constitutional mandate where our natural resources are used for the benefit of Namibian citizens"". 
Namibia often witnessed such events, primarily because the country is located in dought-prone Southern Africa. In 2013, 2016 and 2019, the Namibian government had declared emergencies due to extreme drought. 

However, the ongoing drought has been widespread and devastating, The New York Times quoted Juliane Zeidler, the country director of the World Wildlife Fund in Namibia, as saying. 

The drought, that began in Botswana in October 2023, spread and intensified across Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Namibia, and affects most of southern Africa today, as per a report by the European Commission.

Meanwhile, several media reports have suggested that the situation prevails because of El Nino, a weather pattern associated with extreme heat and dry spells in many parts of the world and the ocean, returned after seven years in 2023 and caused above-average temperatures across various regions. 

In addition, numerous studies have revealed that due to the global warming and constant climate change, extreme weather conditions such as floods and drought have become more frequent and recurring. 

How the drought has affected Namibia?

According to a spokesperson of the United Nations, crops such as maize have dried up, large numbers of livestock have died, and almost 84% of the country’s food reserves are exhausted, leaving its citizens starving. 

Moreover, as the stocks diminishes, the prices have skyrocketed which has limited the access of food to a large percentage of the population. 

“Between April and June 2024, an estimated 1.2 million people…in Namibia face high levels of acute food insecurity…and require urgent action to reduce food gaps and protect livelihoods. These are the most vulnerable groups…in both urban and rural areas,” the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said in a report. 

Notably, food availability is usually low in Namibia from July to September. However, the ongoing crisis has worsened the situation. 

How butchering animals will help the citizens?

According to a report by The Indian Express, it is not just for the meat that the government wants to kill wild animals. Also, the government reckons that due to the widespread drought, the animals might come out of the wild in quest of food and water and end up engaging in conflicts with the human population. 

With 24,000 elephants, Namibia has the world's largest elephant population in the world. 

 ","Namibia is planning to cull over 700 wild animals, including elephants, hippos, and zebras, to provide meat amid a severe drought affecting Southern Africa. The country, facing one of its worst droughts in a century, has already killed more than 150 animals, yielding 63 tonnes of meat. The government argues that this measure is necessary to support its population of 1.4 billion people.

The drought, exacerbated by El Niño and climate change, has devastated crops, decimated livestock, and depleted food reserves, leading to high food prices and severe food insecurity. The culling aims to prevent potential conflicts between wildlife and humans as animals search for resources.

Namibia, with the world's largest elephant population, is also concerned about the animals encroaching on human settlements in their search for food and water. The government’s approach seeks to manage both the immediate food crisis and the risks posed by wild animals during the drought",International News,151,513

In June, soon after he was sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan made a special request to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was on the star-studded dais. Walking past CM Chandrababu Naidu and his son and minister Nara Lokesh, Modi and Kalyan headed towards a beaming Chiranjeevi – Telugu mega star and Kalyan’s brother. The three then held hands and raised them, facing a cheering crowd of onlookers.

In retrospect, that moment stands out – in the four months since then, the ‘Power Star’, as Kalyan is known in film circles, has traded his white attire for shades of saffron. On October 3, dressed similarly, he declared to a crowd at Tirupati, “I am a Sanatani Hindu”, and pledged to sacrifice his life for the religion.","

The Statesman,2024-10-18 00:00:00,Oil resilience: The Statesman,"India seems well-prepared to navigate the uncertainties, as reassured by the union petroleum minister. West Asia has historically been a crucial region for global oil supplies, and any conflict in this area tends to trigger fluctuations in prices.

NEW DELHI – India’s energy security has always been a strategic priority, given its dependence on oil imports to meet over 85 per cent of its consumption. In the current scenario, with escalating tensions in West Asia, the country’s ability to manage potential disruptions in oil supply is being tested once again. However, India seems well-prepared to navigate the uncertainties, as reassured by the union petroleum minister. West Asia has historically been a crucial region for global oil supplies, and any conflict in this area tends to trigger fluctuations in prices.

Recent developments have already caused oil prices to rise, nearing $80 a barrel. Despite this, petroleum minister Hardeep Singh Puri has conveyed confidence that the country can secure its energy needs, even in the face of potential supply hits from the region. His confidence stems from a combination of strategic planning, market dynamics, and evolving energy policies that are gradually reducing India’s vulnerability to such geopolitical risks. One of the key points highlighted is that the global oil market is currently awash with supplies. There is more oil available than consumed, meaning that even if certain traditional suppliers from West Asia reduce exports due to regional conflicts, India has options to source oil from other countries. This diversification of supply sources is a critical factor in India’s resilience.

Over the years, India has actively pursued relationships with new oil suppliers, including those in the Americas and Africa. This strategy of diversifying import partners has been instrumental in reducing India’s over-reliance on any single region. Moreover, the global oil supply is governed by OPEC+, a group that includes major oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia. While OPEC+ has been cutting production in recent years to stabilise prices amid weaker demand, the group is scheduled to raise production from December. This expected increase in output should further ease concerns of any immediate shortages. India’s proactive stance on building oil reserves has also enhanced its ability to manage short-term supply disruptions.

With sufficient oil reserves to tide over temporary supply constraints, India is better equipped than before to handle shocks in the oil market. However, while the current outlook remains cautiously optimistic, there is no denying that any prolonged conflict in West Asia will continue to impact global oil prices. Rising prices could hurt India economically, as higher import costs would increase inflationary pressures and widen the fiscal deficit. To counter these risks in the long term, India must continue to prioritise the diversification of its energy mix, particularly by expanding its renewable energy sector. Reducing dependence on imported oil is a strategic imperative that aligns with global trends toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources.

India’s position as the world’s third-largest oil consumer underscores the importance of energy security in maintaining economic stability. By continuing to invest in alternative energy sources and bolstering strategic oil reserves, India can ensure greater resilience against future geopolitical disruptions in the oil market.","India's energy security is crucial due to its reliance on oil imports for over 85% of its consumption. Amid escalating tensions in West Asia, which is vital for global oil supplies, India’s preparedness to handle potential disruptions has been reassured by the Union Petroleum Minister. Although recent developments have caused oil prices to rise, India’s strategy of diversifying oil suppliers, including partners from the Americas and Africa, has reduced dependence on West Asia. Additionally, the global oil market has surplus supplies, and OPEC+ is set to increase production. India’s proactive approach in building oil reserves further enhances its resilience. However, prolonged conflicts in West Asia could still impact global prices, potentially leading to inflation and a widened fiscal deficit.

The Economic Times,2024-08-07 00:00:00,"From Vinesh Phogat to Brij Bhushan, episodes that marred Indian wrestling in past year and half","Vinesh Phogat: As India comes to terms with the enormous Olympic misfortune of superstar grappler Vinesh Phogat, the memory of last year's fierce wrestlers' protests -- led by her, Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik -- seems to have receded to the background. Although the memory of the wrestlers' protest is fading away from national consciousness, the bitter aftertaste of the protests and the heavy-handed govt response has lingered in the country's wrestling community.

Although the memory of the wrestlers' protest is fading away from national consciousness, the bitter aftertaste of the protests and the heavy-handed govt response has lingered in the country's wrestling community.

At the Olympics 2024, the unseeded Vinesh registered hugely impressive performances on her road to the final -- including the defeat of reigning Olympic champion Yui Susaki of Japan and of Ukraine’s eighth seed Oksana Livach, a former European champion. In the semifinal, Vinesh beat Cuba's Yusneylys Guzman 5-0.

Barely a year ago, it had seemed all over for Vinesh as the government adopted a stern stance against the protesting wrestlers and opted for strong-arm tactics to quell the protest .      How the protest began
In was in January 2023 that wrestlers began a protest at Jantar Mantar, accusing WFI chief Brij Bhushan Singh Sharan of sexual exploitation and intimidation. The protesters demanded his resignation and dissolution of the federation.

The wrestlers sent a complaint letter to Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president PT Usha, demanding the setting up of an inquiry committee to probe the allegations. They also sought a new committee to run WFI in consultation with the wrestlers. In response, IOA formed a committee, including M C Mary Kom and Yogeshwar Dutt, to probe the matter.
A few days after the protest began, the wrestlers called it off after meeting minister Anurag Thakur, with the minister promising that Brij Bhushan would step aside till the probe is wrapped up.

Wrestlers contest panel constitution
The WFI, meanwhile, denied all allegations of sexual harassment of women wrestlers by its president and coaches. The Sports Ministry then asked the WFI to suspend all ongoing activities with immediate effect. The Assistant secretary of WFI, Vinod Tomar, was suspended.

Then, as a 5-member Oversight Committee (OC), led by Mary Kom, began looking into the allegations, wrestlers expressed disappointment that they were not consulted by the government on the choice of the committee members.


The WFI announces election on May 7 after the OC's report was submitted to the Sports Ministry, but was not made public. It triggered the wrestlers to return to Jantar Mantar. According to the protesters, 7 female wrestlers, including a minor, had filed a sexual harassment complaint against Brij Bhushan at the CP police station but the police didn't register an FIR.

The wrestlers also took issue with the Sports Ministry for not yet making the OC's findings public. They subsequently moved the top court seeking registration of FIR against Brij Bhushan.
Protesters 'manhandled', female wrestlers 'misbehaved with'
On May 3, 2023, a scuffle broke out between the wrestlers and the Delhi Police, leading to head injuries to a couple of protesters. Protesters accused ""drunk officials of manhandling"" them and ""misbehaving"" with the female wrestlers. The altercation led to detention while some wrestlers also sustained injuries.

With Brij Bhushan consistently denying all allegations, the wrestlers challenged him to take NARCO test.

Vinesh, Sakshi Malik and Bajrang Punia, along with other protesters, booked for rioting and obstructing public servant in discharge of duty when they attempted to march towards the new Parliament.

Vinesh vs Brij Bhushan: Current status
A Delhi court, on May 21, 2024, formally framed the charges against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh and Vinod Tomar. They denied all the allegations and claimed trial.

The Court on May 10 ordered on 'framing of charge' on Sexual Harassment allegations levelled by several women wrestlers against former WFI Chief and BJP leader Brij Bhushan Singh and Tomar.

While passing the order, the court had said there was sufficient material against Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh to proceed with the sexual harassment of five women wrestlers and with the offence of outraging the modesty of a woman.

As of now, it is an ongoing case where a final ruling has not come. As Vinesh was taking guard for the big night, media glare was back on her fighting spirit and on how she took down a foe who outmatched her in every way.

Despite missing the Gold in heartbreaking fashion, her name will be etched in gold in Indian wrestling folklore. Although she could not conquer the last mile, it is a victory for her nonetheless -- history will remember her as the fighter who never backed down and won not just on the mat but off it too.
","As India grapples with the fallout from Vinesh Phogat's Olympic disappointment, memories of last year's wrestlers' protests, which she spearheaded alongside Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, seem to fade. The protests arose in January 2023 at Jantar Mantar, where wrestlers accused Wrestling Federation of India (WFI) chief Brij Bhushan Singh of sexual exploitation and demanded his resignation. Despite a government inquiry and initial promises for action, wrestlers grew frustrated with the lack of transparency and consultation regarding the oversight committee formed to investigate the allegations.

Vinesh’s remarkable Olympic journey included victories over top competitors, but ultimately, she fell short of the gold medal. The memory of her protests and the government’s heavy-handed response still lingers within the wrestling community, underscoring the unresolved tensions between athletes and authorities. As of now, the court has framed charges against Brij Bhushan for sexual harassment, but a final ruling is pending.

Despite her Olympic loss, Vinesh's determination and resilience resonate strongly, marking her as a significant figure in Indian wrestling history. Her legacy extends beyond the mat, embodying the fight for justice and integrity in sports.",Sports,182,789
Business standards,2024-10-29 00:00:00,8 best eco-friendly Diwali tips to reduce air pollution and protect health,"Diwali is a time of celebration that unfortunately also leads to a surge in air pollution. The best way to reduce air pollution and make it safe and pollution free is to adopt eco-friendly practices. Enjoy the festivities while protecting our environment and health. Here are eight effective ways to combat air pollution this Diwali.
1. Eco-friendly diyas and decorations
Traditional clay diyas are biodegradable making them a great choice as they don't contribute to pollution. Avoid plastic decorations and replace them with natural materials like flowers, leaves, and fabric to adorn your home. This way, you're reducing the plastic waste that often ends up polluting the environment.
 

2. Use natural colours for Rangoli
Synthetic colours contain harmful chemicals that are bad for both the environment and your health. This Diwali avoid using chemical colours and use natural colours made from turmeric, coffee powder, flower petals, and rice flour. These are not only safe options, but they also add a beautiful, earthy touch to your festive décor.
3. Switch to LED lights
LED lights consume significantly less energy compared to traditional incandescent bulbs. Using LED lights for your Diwali decorations will not only reduce your electricity bill but also lower the overall carbon footprint. They’re brighter and last longer, making them a win-win for your celebration.

4. Use green firecrackers
Diwali looks incomplete with firecrackers, but they are also the major contributors to air pollution. The smoke and harmful chemicals released can have severe health effects, particularly for children and the elderly. Hence, it is advisable to opt for green crackers which are not harmful to the environment. You can enjoy other activities like singing, dancing, or playing games with your family.
5. Plant a tree
Balance out the carbon footprint of your Diwali celebrations by planting a tree. It’s a great way to give back to the environment and can become a fun activity for the whole family. Trees are crucial for absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, helping to improve air quality.

6. Choose eco-friendly gifts
When buying gifts, opt for eco-friendly options like organic products, handmade items, or plants. Avoid items with excessive packaging. You can also consider giving experiences, like a yoga class or a cooking workshop, which don’t contribute to waste.

7. Minimise food waste
Prepare an appropriate quantity of food to avoid wastage. If you have leftovers, share them with those in need or compost them. Avoid single-use plastic utensils and plates; instead, use reusable or biodegradable alternatives.
8. Carpool or use public transport
Travelling to meet friends and family is a big part of Diwali. Reduce your carbon footprint by carpooling or using public transportation. Not only does this decrease the number of vehicles on the road, thus reducing emissions, but it also eases traffic congestion.","To celebrate a pollution-free Diwali, adopt eco-friendly practices like using biodegradable diyas, natural Rangoli colors, and LED lights. Opt for green firecrackers, plant a tree, and choose eco-friendly gifts. Minimize food waste and avoid single-use plastics. Additionally, carpool or use public transport to reduce your carbon footprint, ensuring a festive atmosphere that protects the environment and public health.

Times of India,2024-09-07 00:00:00, 'Intent of slaughtering as many Jews as possible': Pakistani arrested for plotting terrorist attack in New York,"A 20-year-old Pakistani national, named Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, living in Canada was taken into custody after being charged with attempting to orchestrate an attack in New York City and providing material support and resources to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), according to a statement released by the US Department of Justice on Friday.
As per the statement, Attorney general Merrick B Garland said that Khan who also goes by the name Shahzeb Jadoon allegedly planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7 ""with the intent of slaughtering in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible.""

Khan attempted to travel from Canada to New York City and intended to carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn, New York. He was arrested in Canada, just 12 miles (19 km) from the US border.
""We are deeply grateful to our Canadian partners for their critical law enforcement actions in this matter. Jewish communities like all communities in this country should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,"" Garland said in the statement.

Around November 2023, Khan began expressing his support for ISIS on social media platforms and through encrypted messaging applications. During this time, he shared ISIS propaganda videos and literature with others. Later, Khan started engaging in communication with two undercover law enforcement officers, according to the statement.
Khan told two undercover law enforcement officers to obtain AR-style assault rifles, ammunition, and other materials to carry out the attacks, and identified locations where the attacks would take place and shared information about his plans to cross the border from Canada into the United States to execute the attacks.

The planned attack was set for around Oct. 7, 2024, nearly a year after Hamas launched an assault in Israel, resulting in over 1,000 deaths. Khan said that ""Oct 7th and Oct 11th are the best days for targeting the Jews"" citing October 7 as the anniversary of the Hamas attack on Israel and October 11 as Yom Kippur, a Jewish religious holiday.


The Pakistani national faces a single count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organisation. If found guilty, he could receive a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The final sentence will be determined by a federal district court judge, who will consider the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.

FBI Director Christopher Wray said, ""The defendant was allegedly determined to kill Jewish people here in the United States, nearly one year after Hamas' horrific attack on Israel. This investigation was led by the FBI, and I am proud of the terrific work by the FBI team and our partners to disrupt Khan's plan.""


“The FBI will continue to work closely with our partners to investigate and hold accountable those who seek to commit violence in the name of ISIS or other terrorist organizations. Fighting terrorism remains the FBI's top priority,"" Wray added.","Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, a 20-year-old Pakistani national living in Canada, was charged with planning a terrorist attack in New York City and providing support to ISIS. He intended to target Jewish people at a Brooklyn center around October 7, 2024. Khan faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.

Two of the dead were students and the third was a pedestrian, the reports added.

The deaths were reported Tuesday after an overnight violence at a public university near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka. The overnight violence involved members of a pro-government student body and other students, when police fired tear gas and charged the protesters with batons during the clashes which spread at Jahangir Nagar University in Savar, outside Dhaka, according to students and authorities.

Protesters have been demanding an end to a quota reserved for family members of veterans who fought in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971, which allows them to take up 30% of governmental jobs.

They argue that quota appointments are discriminatory and should be merit-based. Some even said the current system benefits groups supporting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Some Cabinet ministers criticized the protesters, saying they played on students' emotions.","Violence erupted on university campuses in Dhaka, Bangladesh, over a government jobs quota system, resulting in three deaths, including two students and a pedestrian, and dozens injured.

DNA,2024-09-01 00:00:00,As China’s Shadow Looms :US Bolsters Defence Capabilities of India,"India and the US have signed two important defence agreements, showing increased American support for South Asia as China’s military presence grows. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s recent visit to the US resulted in two key defence pacts being signed—the Security of Supply Arrangement (SoSA) and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) on the Assignment of Liaison Officers.

The Memorandum of Agreement on the Assignment of Liaison Officers permits both countries to deploy military officers within each other’s forces. India will send an officer to the US Special Operations Command in Florida as part of the agreement.

According to Michael Rubin, a former Pentagon official, who spoke to South China Morning Post (SCMP), these agreements are a significant turning point, showing that the US is now backing up its words with concrete support for India. The next step to watch out for would be how the US expands on this agreement, indicating more cooperation in future. The first agreement is, usually, the most difficult to negotiate, but the second, third and fourth agreements are typically easier to reach.
The SoSA, a bilateral agreement that is not legally binding, requires both nations to give importance to providing assistance for defence-related products and services. The goal of the agreement is to guarantee access to essential industrial resources and address vulnerabilities in the supply chain that are crucial for national security. According to the US Department of Defense, India will receive guarantees through Washington’s Defense Priorities and Allocations System in exchange for Indian companies offering priority assistance to the US.

Rubin, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, at a discussion with the SCMP, emphasised India’s critical requirement for dependable alternatives to Russian military equipment, specifically in such areas as aircraft engines and missile systems. Speculating on whether advanced systems were included in the talks, he said America’s longstanding worries about India’s relationship with Russia were on the wane.

He stated that the lack of opposition from Congress regarding this agreement indicated a remarkable achievement by New Delhi in gaining consensus in Washington. This highlights the growing trust the US has in India, as the influence of the Pakistan lobby diminishes. By entering into these agreements, India becomes one of 18 elite SoSA partners, joining the ranks of Australia, Canada and Britain.

Richard Rossow, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies, spoke of how the agreement could impact ties. In conversation with SCMP, he mentioned that, in a scenario where either of our countries faced a critical situation or engaged in conflict with an opponent, the SoSA could speed up the supply of essential weapons and materials necessary for defence. This highlights the importance of the agreement in urgent situations.

The recent India-China clashes demonstrate how fragile peace in the region is. Although there were no shots fired, it highlights the ongoing tensions between the two countries. As China’s influence in South Asia increases, particularly in Pakistan and the Maldives, according to Rossow, India’s strong military and nuclear capabilities give it an advantage over its neighbour, Pakistan. This means the SoSA is less likely to be used in response to emergencies involving Pakistan.

US Strategic Memorandum of Agreement

India and the US have additional strategic agreements, such as the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement signed in 2016, and real-time intelligence sharing starting in 2018 through the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement.

According to Rossow, when comparing the SoSA deals the US is involved in, there are no specific restrictions on the types of weapons India can acquire under this agreement. However, it does not automatically grant India access to more advanced weaponry than what would typically be approved. While other technology release regulations still apply, the agreement helps speed up the delivery of goods and services that have been contracted.

In 2019, India and the US made a notable advancement by signing the Industrial Security Annex. This agreement enables the sharing of classified US information with private Indian defence companies, marking a change from the previous limitations set by the 2002 General Security of Military Information Agreement.

Rossow believes India would not have strengthened its ties with the US without significant security compulsions. He mentioned that China is the only rival to India with greater military strength. Rossow added that the SOSA provisions are not likely to be activated unless there is a serious emergency, indicating that the agreement is influenced by concerns about China.

An Indian defence analyst, speaking to the SCMP on condition of anonymity, lauded the SoSA as a significant milestone. He said that, during the bilateral talks, Rajnath Singh and his US counterpart had agreed to advance several co-production projects in jet engines, unmanned platforms and munitions. He also pointed out the Reciprocal Defence Procurement Agreement (RDPA) as a potentially more impactful one. While the earlier deals concentrated on interoperability, both SoSA and RDPA would simplify defence trade, allowing private companies to more easily compete for each other’s contracts.

The RDPA will let US companies bypass the Trump-era ‘Buy American’ rule, allowing them to set up manufacturing in India and participate in joint defence projects. The US has RDPA agreements with 28 countries.

Defence expert Lt-Gen. (retd) Raj Shukla of the Indian Army sees the SoSA as an instrument to bolster the Indo-US defence ties, says the SCMP. It would become easier for both countries to buy military equipment through broader collaboration, he explained. Although the SoSA is not directly targeting China, Shukla noted that having a technologically advanced Indian military is in line with American interests. “It will help limit Chinese military growth and maintain a balanced power dynamic in Asia, rather than being dominated by one country,” he said.

","India and the US have signed two key defence agreements: the Security of Supply Arrangement (SoSA) and a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) on Liaison Officers. These agreements reflect increased American support for India as China's military influence grows. The SoSA aims to ensure a reliable supply of defence-related products and services, while the MoA allows military officers from both countries to be deployed within each other's forces. The agreements mark a significant shift, showcasing deeper US-India military cooperation and addressing India's need for alternatives to Russian equipment. The SoSA and RDPA (Reciprocal Defence Procurement Agreement) simplify defence trade and enhance joint projects, emphasizing India's growing strategic importance in the region",International News,110,946

As per the DPR submitted by TNPHC. It will take at least three years to complete the construction of the first phase of the prison.

“The new prison is designed to have separate blocks for remand and convicted prisoners, for efficient management within the same facility,” DIG (Prisons) G Shanmugasundaram (Coimbatore Range) told TNIE. He added that the new prison will be the first in the state to feature a single block capable of accommodating around 1,000 remand prisoners at a time. The existing prison consists of multiple blocks, each with a capacity of 100 to 150 prisoners.

The existing central prison was established in 1872 and is one of the oldest prisons in the state, spanning 165 acres. It accommodates over 1,500 prisoners across various blocks, including those remand, conviction, high-security inmates and others. The existing prison currently manages 2,300 inmates, including 200 women, while the new one is planned to accommodate 3,000 inmates, including 500 women. In 2010, the then-chief minister proposed to relocate the prison and construct a Semmozhi Poonga in its place.

As per DPR, the new prison complex will come up on 95 acres at Rs 327.33 crore. The construction will be done in three phases - the first phase will cost Rs 211.57 crore, the second Rs 46.55 crore and the third phase will be constructed at Rs 69.21 crore. There would be four blocks - remand, convict, high-security and condemned. Besides, the campus would also house a court, hospital, workshop, kitchen, administration block, staff quarters and other facilities. Along with it, there is a plan to construct an STP and a solid waste management system.

The men’s prison will be completed in the first phase, followed by the women’s prison. The third phase will involve building staff quarters and other basic infrastructure, TNPHC sources said.","The Tamil Nadu Police Housing Corporation (TNPHC) plans to float a tender in January 2025 for the construction of a new central prison complex in Onnipalayam village, Bilichi, near Karamadai, after receiving administrative sanction.

A Bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta however observed that certain legal questions arising out of Mr. Kejriwal’s plea challenging his arrest by the central agency need to be referred to a larger Bench. 

However, the Chief Minister will continue to remain in Tihar jail as he has been separately arrested by the Central Bureau Of Investigation (CBI) in a corruption case related to the alleged scam.

“We are conscious that Arvind Kejriwal is an elected leader and the Chief Minister of Delhi, a post holding influence and importance”, the judges underscored while granting him the interim relief. 

During the proceedings, the ED had argued that there was evidence of money being sent to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) through hawala channels. On Thursday, the agency said in its seventh supplementary chargesheet that Mr. Kejriwal was the “kingpin” and “key conspirator” in the alleged scam. Opposing such assertions, senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing Mr. Kejriwal, argued that the evidence being cited by the federal agency was not present during the Chief Minister’s arrest.

Though Jadeja has been part of the Indian T20I setup for a long time his contributions with the bat have been few and far between. His limitations as a T20 batsman come from his deficiencies in his range hitting. He isn’t the power hitter that a team would slot in the lower order.

However, the Indian top order in T20Is has been populated with star names which meant that Jadeja had to bat in the lower order for the team as an all-rounder.

The Tesla Inc. co-founder and X owner will present Meloni with the Atlantic Council’s Global Citizen Award at a ceremony on Sept. 23, according to people familiar with the matter. Previous recipients include Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.

Musk and Meloni have met on a number of occasions, including at a political festival last December thrown by the prime minister’s right-wing Brothers of Italy party. Appearing onstage, Musk discussed Italy’s demographic crisis – the country has one of the lowest birth rates in Europe – and exhorted the crowd to “make more Italians.” 

“As simple as it sounds, if people do not have children there is no new generation,” Musk told the audience, echoing a prominent concern of Meloni’s. The billionaire also warned of the dangers of the “woke mind-virus” — a favorite talking point — and unchecked migration. 

The Atlantic Council event won’t be the only meeting this month between Meloni and the world’s richest man. They’re also scheduling a closed-door conversation to discuss investment opportunities in Italy’s space and artificial intelligence sectors, the people said.

Italy approved a new regulatory framework in June that grants foreign space companies permission to operate in the country, according to a statement by the minister of industry. Italy expects to generate €7.3 billion of investment in the space sector by 2026. 

The controversial tech CEO already has a head start. Italy is among the countries serviced by Starlink, which delivers broadband Internet through a global network of more than 6,000 SpaceX satellites. Both companies are owned by Musk.

Last April, Starlink claimed that Telecom Italia SpA, the country’s largest telecom provider, was obstructing the rollout of its high-speed Internet services.

The Hindu,2024-07-02 00:00:00, ‘Kill’ movie review: Lakshya rampages in propulsive bloodfest,"
The tide has finally turned at Dharma Productions’ action department. Some months ago they gave us Yodha, with Sidharth Malhotra thwacking hijackers on a juddering plane. By comparison, their latest, Kill, featuring newcomer Lakshya in the leading role, is a more grounded effort: a 105-minute brawl on a moving train. If the film turns a profit and a sequel is announced — an English-language remake is already in the works — I would strongly advise the makers not to scale up but to scale down. Kill 2 should ideally take place on an autorickshaw in the Mumbai rains, a real bloodbath.

Director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat trims more fat than I thought was possible from a Dharma screenplay; Sikhya Entertainment, a far-hipper banner with an international outlook, is their co-producer on the film and was likely the countervailing influence. Amrit (Lakshya), an NSG commando, is unwinding from a recent assignment when a new crisis presents itself: his girlfriend, Tulika (Tanya Maniktala), is getting engaged to someone else. The match has been made against her will, at the behest of Tulika’s wealthy, influential father (Harsh Chhaya). With just a day to go, Amrit, a man of instant, indefatigable action, turns up in Ranchi to spirit Tulika out of the function. She declines — “Abort mission,” Amrit quickly alerts his tag-along army buddy, Viresh (Abhishek Chauhan) — promising to reconvene in Delhi and elope on safer ground.

","Dharma Productions' latest action film, Kill, stars newcomer Lakshya in a 105-minute brawl on a moving train.

Now, as soon as LSG announced their picks, team owner Sanjiv Goenka seemingly took a dig at KL Rahul. In a video message that was played on Star Sports, Sanjiv Goenka was seen explaining the reasoning behind retaining Pooran, Bishnoi, Badoni, Mohsin and Mayank.

""It was a simple mindset to go in with players who have a mindset to win, who put the team first before their personal goals and personal aspirations and we wanted to retain as much as of core we could,"" said Sanjiv Goenka.

Nicholas Pooran was an automatic choice
Sanjiv Goenka also said that picking Nicholas Pooran was a no-brainer, and the franchise wanted to have its core intact ahead of the mega auction.


""Our first retention which was an automatic choice, happened within like less than two minutes. We have two uncapped retentions that is Mohsin Khan and Ayush Badoni. It was a process that Zaheer Khan, Justin Langer and the analyst were involved in,"" said Sanjiv Goenka.

""We have went with three bowlers from previous seasons, all Indians. Pooran was a no-brainer for everyone. Ayush has done well for us at No.6 or No.7,"" he added.

KL Rahul played 14 matches for LSG in IPL 2024 and he scored 520 runs at an average of 37.14. However, his strike rate came under severe scrutiny, and he was often criticised for his pace while at the crease.

In IPL 2024, KL Rahul had a strike rate of 136.13. Overall, the right-handed batter played 38 matches for LSG, scoring more than 1,200 runs.

KL Rahul is now entering the mega auction, and it needs to be seen which franchise picks him up. 
","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjiv Goenka implied criticism of KL Rahul after releasing him and retaining other players.  Goenka emphasized the retained players' team-first mentality and winning attitude, a subtle contrast to Rahul's perceived prioritization of personal goals.

Indian Express ,2024-08-26 00:00:00,"Facing heat, Amazon plans to set up resting points for delivery workers across cities","Over the coming years, e-commerce major Amazon plans to open a number of rest points for delivery workers, which would be equipped with drinking water, air conditioning, seating area, and mobile charging points. On Friday, the company inaugurated the first such facility in Gurugram.

The facility will be accessible to all delivery workers, and not just those in Amazon’s fleet, the company’s vice president, operations, Abhinav Singh told The Indian Express. Drivers would be required to register their details with a security professional guarding the facility, following which they could use the resting point for 30 minutes. At its peak, the facility in Gurugram could host up to 15 people, Singh said.
“The aim is to make sure that before the summer months set in, all cities which have high humidity or heat, and where we have a significant amount of presence in terms of a network of points should have resting points like this,” Singh said. Asked if the company was targeting a particular number of such facilities, he said, “We haven’t taken an end target in mind because it will depend on the need that we have… But, suffice to say that you will have multiple points starting with cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Pune…”
Amazon is not the first gig-work oriented company that is setting up such resting points. Food delivery major Zomato also operates some facilities like these across the country. The move comes as Amazon, and other companies that make the gig economy have repeatedly been accused of poor working conditions, especially for delivery workers, who more often than not work with these entities as contractual labourers with little to no benefits.

Asked what prompted the company to launch such a facility now, given that Amazon entered India over a decade ago, Singh said, “It’s one of those things that just happened now… Ideally everything could have happened 10 years ago… Summers now are harsher than they used to be three to four or five years ago… The level of humidity is higher”.
The Indian Express had reported that earlier this year, a group of employees was made to take an oath that they would not take toilet and water breaks until their target was met. The National Human Rights Commission had quoted the The Indian Express report and asked for a report from the Labour Ministry. On June 21, the ministry wrote to Amazon, seeking a response to the alleged incident.
“Our investigation revealed that on May 16, 2024, around 16:30 hours, after both the breaks for the day had been taken, one of the employees at the building did lead a small subset of employees and associates at the Subject FC (Fulfilment Centre) in a pledge. The employee thought of the pledge as a motivational exercise. This was an unfortunate and isolated incident and a clear violation of our workplace standards…” Amazon said in response.","
Amazon is planning to establish resting points for its delivery workers across various cities in response to growing concerns over their working conditions. The move comes amid increasing scrutiny of the treatment of delivery personnel, who often face long hours, challenging working environments, and minimal breaks during their shifts.
These resting points, also known as ""Rest Stops,"" will provide delivery workers with safe spaces where they can take breaks, rest, and recharge during their delivery routes. These facilities are expected to offer basic amenities such as seating, water, restrooms, and possibly even charging stations for their devices. The initiative aims to improve the overall well-being and morale of delivery workers, ensuring they have the necessary support to perform their duties efficiently.
This step is seen as part of Amazon’s broader effort to address criticisms about the harsh working conditions faced by its gig workers. By setting up these resting points, Amazon hopes to mitigate some of the physical and mental stress associated with the job, thereby improving job satisfaction and retention among its workforce.
The initiative reflects Amazon's recognition of the essential role delivery workers play in its operations and the importance of their well-being in maintaining smooth and efficient delivery services across the cities.",Business and Finance,205,482
Mint,2025-01-04 00:00:00,Cowpea seeds take root in space: A major step in ISROs space farming efforts,"The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has achieved a significant breakthrough in space research with the successful germination of cowpea seeds in space. The seeds, part of the Compact Research Module for Orbital Plant Studies (CROPS) experiment, sprouted within just four days of being sent into space aboard the PSLV-C60 mission.
On December 30, the PSLV-C60 rocket launched, placing two SpaDeX satellites into orbit, and carrying the POEM-4 platform with 24 onboard experiments. Among them was the CROPS experiment, designed by ISROs Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), to investigate plant growth in the unique environment of microgravity.
In a post shared on X, ISRO celebrated the milestone, ""Life sprouts in space! VSSC's CROPS experiment onboard PSLV-C60 POEM-4 successfully sprouted cowpea seeds in 4 days. Leaves expected soon.""
The experiment aims to explore how plants grow in space, a crucial area of study for long-duration space missions, such as those planned for Mars and beyond. The results could play a pivotal role in ensuring food security for astronauts on extended missions.
Eight cowpea seeds were placed in a controlled, closed-box environment with active thermal regulation to mimic conditions encountered by plants during space travel. The system monitors various factors essential for plant growth, including oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Passive measurements are taken through imaging and other environmental sensors to track the plants' development.
CROPS is part of a larger initiative to evolve ISROs capabilities in sustaining flora in extraterrestrial environments, with future phases expected to focus on longer-term plant growth in space. The current experiment is designed to last between five and seven days, demonstrating seed germination and plant development up to the two-leaf stage.
This success marks another step forward for India in space research, with the CROPS programme poised to provide valuable insights into how plant life can be sustained in space. As humanity looks towards the future of space exploration, understanding plant growth in microgravity conditions will be critical for creating sustainable living environments on distant planets.
In addition to the CROPS experiment, ISRO also shared an update on its space docking experiment. The chaser satellite, which is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 470 km, is set to dock with the target satellite on Tuesday. If successful, India will join a select group of nationsRussia, the US, and Chinathat have mastered this advanced technology.

The Statesman,2024-10-16 00:00:00,October 1987 crash in historical perspective,"On 19 October 1987, following three days of decline in the New York stock market, the Hong Kong market dropped 10.5 per cent after a rise of 89 per cent in the previous 12 months.On 19 October 1987, following three days of decline in the New York stock market, the Hong Kong market dropped 10.5 per cent after a rise of 89 per cent in the previous 12 months. October 19 was Black Monday for New York, which triggered a worldwide stock crash. In US dollars terms, eight global stock markets declined by 20 to 29 per cent, three by 30 to 39 per cent, and three (Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore) by more than 40 per cent. The total losses were estimated at $1.7 trillion or just under 10 per cent of world GDP in 1987. The following Tuesday, the Chairman of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) informed the Financial Secretary that the SEHK would suspend trading for the rest of the week, with the Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE) following suit.

There was fear of panic selling, disorderly markets and inability to settle as clients were not meeting their commitments. The global meltdown was halted by the Fed stepping in to provide liquidity, since everyone remembered the October 1929 Great Crash, which marked the beginning of the Great Depression of the 1930s. In Hong Kong, $4 billion worth of liquidity loans were provided, half by the Exchange Fund and balance by the leading banks. On 16 November 1987, the Governor appointed the Securities Review Committee (SRC) to review the constitution, management and operations of the two Exchanges and their regulators. The SRC Chairman was Ian Hay Davison, who was formerly Managing Partner at Arthur Andersen, the leading US/UK  firm of chartered accountants, also Chief Executive of Lloyds, the London insurance market.The people who participated in the Hay Davison Report included a who’s who of Hong Kong and international finance, such as Philip Tose, a member of the SRC and later of Peregrine fame, Paul Tucker, seconded from the Bank of England who rose to become Deputy Governor, and Carrie Lam, later Chief Executive of Hong Kong SAR. The Davison Report essentially concluded that “the concept of selfregulation and market self-discipline had failed to develop in Hong Kong. What is equally unfortunate is that, faced with this, the supervisory bodies charged with overseeing the markets had lost effective control.” It recommended the establishment of an independent securities market regulator, which became the Securities and Futures Commission, established in May 1989, celebrating its 35th anniversary this year.Since the 1987 crash, financial crises seemed to repeat every 10 years, with the Asian financial crisis occurring in 1997/98 and the US subprime crisis, a global financial crisis in 2007/2008. Each financial crisis ended with massive central bank intervention and regulatory reform, but the financial markets kept becoming more complex, interconnected and entangled. The 10-year crisis pattern was somewhat broken when no major financial crisis happened in 2018, mainly because central banks have learned to step in to provide massive liquidity through quantitative easing (QE) or balance sheet expansion. Stock markets, as well as real estate markets, strongly correlated with interest rates, affect overall economic confidence.

At the end of 2022, stock market capitalization was $98.6 trillion or 21 per cent of total global financial institution assets, equivalent to 97 per cent of 2022 world GDP. Curiously, in 1987, the SEHK market cap (US$54 billion) was already 106 per cent of Hong Kong GDP. It was in recognition of the interconnectedness of stock and financial markets that the SEHK, HKFE and Hong Kong Clearing were merged into the Hong Kong Exchanges (HKEx) after their demutualization and listing in March and June 2000 respectively. Since then, the landscape of global financial markets was transformed profoundly, as turnover in volume, value and speed rose with the addition of new derivatives and new technology. As exchange traded funds (ETFs) reach market value of $14 trillion and cyber-currencies are now valued at $2.2 trillion, new tech-driven market makers like Jane Street and Citadel Securities, which trade across multiple markets, are rivalling established investment banks in market power and profitability, as reported in the Financial Times.

In 2021, a US House Finance Committee expert review claimed that one single market maker could trade “approximately 26 per cent of U.S. equities volume” and “executes approximately 47 per cent of all U.S.-listed retail volume, and acts as a specialist or market-maker with respect to 99 per cent of traded volume in 3,000 U.S.-listed options names.” In China, the joint announcement by the heads of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the National Financial Regulatory Authority (NFRA) and China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), which preceded the stock market run-up in Hong Kong and Mainland stock markets, showed how the authorities understand that banking, insurance, fund management, securities markets and real estate are deeply interrelated.

On 10 October 2024, the PBoC announced the creation of a RMB500 billion “Securities, Funds and Insurance Companies Swap Facility (SFISF)” to support qualified securities, funds and insurance companies to use bonds, stock ETFs, CSI 300 constituent stocks and other assets as collateral to exchange for high-grade liquid assets such as treasury bonds and central bank bills from the People’s Bank of China. Financial markets are complex eco-systems because they are deeply entangled with each other, with foreign markets influencing domestic markets and vice-versa. When the rise of deep technology, AI, demographics, geopolitical rivalries and natural disasters and events are added to this mix, the need to understand what is happening, act fast and address key structural issues becomes more important than ever.

The legacy of silo’ed, top-down bureaucracies and specialist agencies to manage deeply entangled financial institutions all encroaching in each other’s markets is no longer adequate to cope with the emergence of new products, markets and institutions that arbitrage new regulations faster than lawmakers can manage. Few can understand the complexity of market products or their rules and regulations. There is a bitter lesson from financial crash history. If you don’t reform early enough, financial crises force you to reform. It’s not just the instant market volatility that matters, there are deep structural forces at work which we need to understand, sometimes beyond the powers of any single national regulator. Surviving such complexity needs the humility to listen to how markets are changing by the minute.","In 1987, the Hong Kong stock market experienced a significant drop, triggering a worldwide stock crash.

Practical alternatives include reusable fabric bags for fruits and vegetables, reusable containers for meats, fish, and cheese, refillable bottles and jars for oils, vinegar, and cleaning liquids, and beeswax wraps instead of foil and clingfilm. Several innovative materials offer sustainable alternatives to plastic, such as bamboo, which is versatile and fast-growing and can replace plastic in items like cutlery, tissues, and planters. Upcycled tyres can be used to make wallets, planters, and bags, while almost every part of a coconut can be repurposed into items like bowls, mugs, and combs.

Additionally, reusable glass bottles and containers are safe for food storage and have a lower pollution footprint when recycled. Surprisingly, cow dung can be used to make utility trays, carry bags, and gift boxes. Tree-free paper, made from agricultural byproducts, can replace traditional paper products without cutting down trees. Upcycling fabric into items like masks, cushion covers, and purses reduces textile waste, and jute, strong and durable, is a sustainable alternative for bags, pouches, and notebooks. Cork, recyclable and biodegradable, can be used for wallets, yoga mats, and passport holders, while wheat straw, an agricultural byproduct, can be used to make durable cutlery and other items.

Addressing plastic pollution requires collective action from individuals, communities, businesses, and governments. By reducing single-use plastics, promoting recycling, supporting innovative substitutes, participating in clean-up initiatives, and advocating for systemic change, we can establish a healthier and more sustainable environment. Adopting these strategies will help us combat plastic pollution and create a cleaner, greener future for the coming generations.

While it is essential to replace plastic, it is equally important to evaluate the environmental impact of potential substitutes. The UN emphasizes utilizing natural materials from mineral, plant, animal, marine, or forestry sources that can mimic plastic, highlighting the importance of differentiating between various alternatives, such as bioplastics and biodegradable plastics.

Bioplastics, derived from plants, are seen as green alternatives to fossil fuel-based plastics, particularly for food packaging. However, they have an environmental footprint due to the land and water needed to grow crops. They can be as harmful as conventional plastics, especially if they reach the oceans. Biodegradable plastics, designed to break down by natural organisms, may still leave toxic residues in the environment. Compostable plastics require specific conditions to decompose and are not collected by most waste management systems, limiting their effectiveness.","Addressing global plastic pollution requires embracing eco-friendly alternatives while carefully evaluating their environmental impacts.

From advanced image recognition to robust predictive analytics, AI empowers healthcare providers to make well-informed decisions. As a result, we’re witnessing earlier disease detection, more precise treatments, and improved patient outcomes. Our unwavering commitment is to deliver innovative, comprehensive primary healthcare solutions, recognising that digital innovation is crucial for fostering a healthier India. The power of AI and digital solutions
Digital innovations are transforming not only clinical applications, but also streamlining administrative processes making the entire health care experience more patient-centric. Mobile health apps and the government's eSanjeevani - National Telemedicine Service have revolutionised access to health care, especially in remote areas. Patients can now receive consultations and diagnostics without travelling long distances, significantly reducing barriers to care. Additionally, wearable devices and mobile health apps empower patients to actively manage their health. They can monitor vital signs, track treatment adherence, and focus on overall wellness. These tools promote preventive healthcare and also foster closer patient-provider relationships, encouraging individuals to take charge of their health.The journey from Digitalised Health and Wellness Centres (DHWC) to Comprehensive Primary Healthcare (CPHC) exemplifies India's commitment to changing primary care. Initiated by WISH in 2017, DHWC introduced a '3 Tab model' (Nurse, Doctor, Pharmacist) across 1,000 centres in five states and two cities. Despite initial success, the model encountered challenges stemming from the lack of National Digital Health Blueprint (NDHB) standards, Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) building blocks, and difficulties in adapting to rapid technological shifts, especially evident during the Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.
To address these issues, the Smart DHWC was developed, integrating NDHB standards, ABDM building blocks, AI capabilities, and a robust clinical knowledge base. This enhanced model prioritised preventive health measures, streamlined data management, and improved patient experiences through technologically advanced health centres. Now, aligned with priorities of the government i.e. Comprehensive Primary Health Care through Health and Wellness Centres (Ayushman Arogya Mandirs), we have developed an Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) compliant 'CPHC platform' to enable DHWCs. The CPHC platform is declared in opensource as Digital Public Good (DPG). This platform has two digital components-application for patients and, the Electronic Health Records (EHR) application at the clinics for registration, entry of health vitals, doctor consultation, lab testing, pharmacy and referrals. The CPHC platform has the capability of tagging/ tracking of patients using RFID tags and monitoring of vitals using IoT wearables. Advance healthcare plug-ins (Point of Care Devices) are integrated into the EHR application for auto-populating health vitals.
A pilot implementation of CPHC platform - eSwasthya Dham is being done for the Uttarakhand government. The platform enables monitoring of pilgrims undertaking pilgrimages (Chardham Yatra) in the state of Uttarakhand. It unfolds in three key stages, starting with at-home registration and health assessments, progressing to base location preparations and continuous monitoring at checkpoints throughout the journey. Seamlessly integrated with the Char Dham Registration Portal, the eSwasthya Dham platform allows pilgrims to conveniently access their medical records using their ABHA ID, ensuring easy retrieval of vital health information.
Additionally, an AI chatbot has also been developed as a plug-in to eSwasthya Dham to assist the paramedics in dealing with different medical conditions exhibited by the pilgrims. It has the Non-Cloud Branch —successfully deployed during the CharDham Yatra and the Cloud Branch —designed for statewide implementation, adaptable to any state. The other use cases encompass NCD management, immunisation and high-risk pregnancy care, highlighting the versatility and impact of the CPHC initiative.
By embracing digital and AI solutions, we have the opportunity to redefine what's possible in the primary healthcare space. As we continue this transformative journey, we remain steadfast in our commitment to using technology to empower an innovation-driven healthcare ecosystem and making high-quality healthcare services available and affordable to all.","The integration of digital technologies and AI is revolutionizing India's public health, particularly in primary care.

The Arunachal Front,2024-10-26 00:00:00,Arunachal: 3 including 2 IRBn jawans arrested for weapon theft from armoury,"Three including two IRBn jawans arrested by Pakke Kessang district police for allegedly stealing a small firearm alongwith ammunition from the armoury of the 3rd India Reserve Battalion (IRBn) BHQ (Battalion Headquarters) at Seijosa in the district, a senior officer said on Friday.

Pakke Kessang SP Tasi Darang said that a written FIR was received at the Seijosa Police Station on Monday stating that 3rd IRBn BHQ’s Central KOTE ( keeper of technical equipment ) has been found broken and one 9mm pistol and 11 live round 9mm bullets were missing.
Acting promptly, a case was registered and the Seijosa PS team led by Sub-Inspector Sang Thinley under the supervision of SP Pakke Kessang swung into action and arrested the three accused persons the next day
The arrestees have been identified as Phuntso Dondup (30) and Haricharan Boro (31) – both constables/general duty, 3rd IRBn, and Md Babul Ali (35), a resident of Kekakuli village under Charduar PS in Assam’s Sonitpur district.

During investigation, one 9mm pistol has been recovered from the nearby bush of Kekakuli village in Sonitpur, on being led and shown by the accused person, Babul Ali, the SP said, adding that 11 live 9mm bullets recovered from the rent house of constable Haricharan at Seijosa
With this, “all the involved arms and ammunition have been recovered,” Darang said.

The accused persons have been booked under relevant sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) and the Arms Act, and further investigations taken up, he said.

The Imphal Free Press,2024-07-14 00:00:00,Manipur: Senapati students association intensifies economic embargo against Kukis,"The Senapati District Students Association (SDSA) has intensified the ban it imposed on economic activities of the Kuki community from the district headquarters, reportedly for the past two days, “in response to ongoing harassment along the highway.” 

When asked about the reason, SDSA stated that they have set up a checkpoint and started inspections to enforce the economic embargo imposed on the Kukis, as per a report published by the Ukhrul Times. 


This action follows their order issued on June 21, 2024, under reference no. SDSA/65/22-24, it said. The prohibition was necessitated after their previous appeal to stop harassing innocent travelers along National Highway 2 and maintain the highway as a safe zone “was met with silence and defiance from the Kuki community.”


Following a press statement dated June 3, 2024 (reference no. SDSA/64/22-24), which appealed to all parties to stop harassment on the highway, incidents of atrocities against the Nagas increased, the SDSA alleged. 


It said that routine harassment of travelers and goods carriers along the highway has become a daily occurrence. For instance, two DI trucks belonging to Liangmai Nagas were hijacked near Damdei College Junction, Motbung, and a huge ransom was demanded without any valid reason, it said. SDSA executives intervened, leading to the unconditional release of the trucks.


It further said that on June 12 and 14, 2024, LPG trucks carrying supplies for Senapati were stopped by armed Kuki miscreants for extortion purposes. Fearing for their safety, the drivers had to return to the gas plant, resulting in a shortage of cooking gas for the people of Senapati. 


It was only after the Senapati Gas Agencies Association initiated a counter-blockade that the KSO met with SDSA and reached an understanding with the gas agencies.


On the night of June 19, 2024, a truck was set ablaze near the Orange Farm, just below T Khullen, by Kuki miscreants. SDSA further said that such acts of arson, regardless of the reasons, were seen as a total disrespect and a direct challenge to authority, showing the audacity to commit such heinous crimes within their jurisdiction.


“These incidents are just a few of the countless atrocities inflicted on the Nagas since the conflict began last month. Despite the state unrest, the Nagas have maintained a peaceful and neutral stance,” it said.  


The SDSA has extended a helping hand providing medical assistance to neighboring K communities, treating their injured, and ensuring they receive necessary help. They have allowed free access to the market and town, ensuring equal treatment and safety.


However, after experiencing repeated incidents, the SDSA found it necessary to check all vehicles and initiate the embargo to show their condemnation. 


Their initial motive was to peacefully communicate their grievances and unhappiness to the Kuki community, but due to continued silence and defiance, the SDSA was forced to adopt this embargo as a form of noncooperation and non-compliance in response to the ongoing troubles caused by the Kuki community, it added.","The Senapati District Students Association (SDSA) has escalated its economic ban on the Kuki community in response to what they perceive as ongoing harassment along National Highway 2. The ban, which has been enforced for the past two days from the district headquarters, involves setting up checkpoints and inspecting vehicles to enforce the embargo. This action follows earlier appeals by SDSA to stop alleged harassment of travelers and goods carriers by Kuki groups, incidents which SDSA claims have increased in severity despite previous warnings. The SDSA cited instances such as hijackings and extortion attempts targeting Nagas, leading to disruptions in essential supplies like cooking gas. Despite efforts to maintain peace and provide aid to neighboring communities, SDSA decided on the embargo as a nonviolent protest against what they view as persistent provocations and defiance from the Kuki community.",Local News,138,491

""The 𝕏 algorithm assumes that if you interact with content, you want to see more of that content. One of the strongest signals is if you forward 𝕏 posts to friends, it assumes you like that content a lot, because it takes effort to forward. Unfortunately, if the actual reason you forwarded the content to friends was because you /were outraged by it, we are currently not smart enough to realise that,"" wrote Elon Musk in his post. (Also Read: Elon Musk’s blunder: Billionaire calls his social media platform Twitter instead of X)

An individual wrote, ""Speaking of X, in-app search needs a lot of work, and I think some sort of integration with Grok would be very useful For example, I wanted to find a video of a meme I wanted to send to someone. I couldn't find the meme by typing what it was on 𝕏 search, but when I asked Grok about the same meme, it quoted posts using the meme. Grok's explore feature has been exceptional. Now I want elements of it included in search results somehow.""

Another X user added, ""I love that X continues to adapt the algo and support all users, including smaller accounts. Premium is so worth it when you make it all back and some in ad revenue.""

""The X algorithm was amazing in December of 2022 and June of 2023. That was the pinnacle of greatness. It’s been downhill since then for a few reasons.

The Statesman,2024-09-26 00:00:00,Preparing students for the future: Integrating AI and robotics into the curriculum,"NEW DELHI – Higher education: A great common denominator

What is higher education? What is its purpose? I quote from UNESCO, “Higher education is a rich cultural and scientific asset that enables personal development and promotes economic, technological and social change. … It equips students with the skills needed to meet ever-changing labour markets. It is a passport to economic security and a stable future.” That is exactly why any higher educational institute (HEI) wants to create an ecosystem that will make our students survive through the challenges of the future.

How challenging is the future job market? Let us retrospect and review the last few years. In these years, the change in workplaces has been disruptively rapid compared to a gradual evolution that we are used to witnessing. The future appears to be harsher. The rate of change is only going to accelerate. The shortage of skilled employees is getting larger. Expectations of Gen Z employees are constantly changing. The final touch on the whole saga is provided by a series of transformative new technologies. In a nutshell, the workplace has witnessed an unforeseeable revolution.

According to the World Economic Forum’s 2023 Future of Jobs Report, 44 per cent of worker skills will be disrupted over the next five years, with analytical skills, creative thinking, and technological literacy among those in the greatest demand. It is predicted that six in ten employees will require further skills training. The question is: Wherefrom will they learn the required skill?

Why and how are the higher education institutes (HEI) going to change the trusted path they have tread for centuries? After all, HEIs are known for ages to foster and inculcate the culture of analytical skills and creative thinking! There is a catch. Of late, our abilities and intelligence are constantly challenged by a new set of transformative technologies. Our learners have to face a world that was like never before. Even the alumni of HEIs are living dangerously as far as the workplace is concerned. The threat is real and simple. Either you master these technologies or these technologies will be your master. The bottom line is that the bottom line of the pyramid is in real danger.

This takes us to the million-dollar question. What are these technologies that are set to be rooted so deep and so fast in our lives? This question will attract diverse responses. But one thing is for sure. So far in all industrial revolutions, technology helped us by providing tools for more mechanisation and automation. For instance, all machines are used to save time and effort and to increase productivity. Computers and software single-handedly brought about a revolution that changed the nature of work. Connectivity forced us to live in a virtual world for a significant part of our lives and was a rude shock to the prevailing social order. The sudden emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications like ChatGPT has turned technology from a tool into, potentially, a virtual co-worker. To be a real coworker, smart bots are coming up that can reach places where humans cannot. This had never ever happened.

Imagine a new you, Ms Univers(ity)

At this juncture, the HEIs have to reimagine and reinvent themselves. Using AI to its best advantage will itself require new skills, many of which are yet to be understood. And Yes. The word “skill” never mattered more. AI is a vertical in its own right. Each body of knowledge has a vertical. But AI grows horizontally too and grows without limits. It penetrates all domains of knowledge, be it the humanities, fine arts, or science and technology. This establishes AI as a necessary skill for the entire population on earth. We also understand that AI can only advise but cannot do so. It is more like a brain that has no motor skills. To make a transition from a virtual coworker to a real coworker, we have to build robots driven by the brain, that is, AI. One can talk with her, ask her to do the chores, or ask her to dig a hole. Amazing!

This settles one issue for the HEI about the minimum skills needed in the curriculum but poses a set of unanswered questions. How easy is it to integrate AI into university curriculum for all disciplines and robotics for some? There are open and shut answers. We know that infrastructure and skilled human resources are required. But the open problem is no one knows so far how to inject these two courses into teaching, keeping a nuanced balance between the actual domain and skill. To elaborate on the point, it is important to build smart bridges that can monitor their health, where a tiny robot can go high up or deep inside for repairing and welding. So, the civil engineers and the architects must know AI and robotics as a skill; otherwise, they will have to rely on the wisdom of an AI engineer and a robot specialist who knows nothing about how to build a bridge. Our curriculum needs a bridge that connects the new technologies to the core domain.

A statutory warning is necessary now. It will be wrong to dislodge the usual emphasis on developing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education. These are indispensable to sustainable development and innovation in the long run. Invention of one equation can create thousands of nuclear reactors and send spaceships to probe the vastness of the universe. Future jobs may be more based on skills than conventional degrees. Our curriculum must keep up with the pace of change by adopting a more interdisciplinary and holistic approach to create a more diverse and tailored talent pool without ignoring fundamental and deeper insights.","Higher education plays a critical role in preparing students for an evolving job market shaped by disruptive technologies.

According to the World Economic Forum’s 2023 Future of Jobs Report, 44% of worker skills will be disrupted in the next five years. To meet these challenges, higher education institutes (HEIs) must adapt by incorporating new technologies like AI and robotics into their curricula. AI, in particular, has become a vital skill across all disciplines, influencing fields beyond technology. However, integrating AI into university programs poses challenges, requiring skilled faculty and infrastructure. HEIs must balance core domain knowledge with new technological skills to stay relevant.

Indian Express,2024-12-20 00:00:00,"Who are Pratap Sarangi and Mukesh Rajput, BJP MPs ‘hospitalised’ after being ‘pushed’ by Rahul Gandhi","THE BJP said Thursday that two of its MPs, Pratap Chandra Sarangi from Balasore in Odisha and Mukesh Rajput from Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh, were injured after being allegedly pushed by Opposition MPs as both sides protested over the B R Ambedkar issue.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up the two MPs, who were taken to RML Hospital, to enquire about their health. Rajput is said to be admitted in the ICU.
Pratap Chandra Sarangi
Sarangi, 69, is a two-time MP and a former Union Minister of State in the second NDA government. He came to the limelight in 2019 after images of him packing a simple bag at his modest thatched house before leaving for Delhi surfaced on X (then Twitter).

In Odisha, Sarangi is known as an austere political activist, maverick and plain spoken. A few years ago, in a television interview to OTV, a regional channel, Sarangi was asked if he was “abibahita” (unmarried) or “brahmacharya” (celibate). Sarangi promptly said “unmarried” and then “no” to the question on celibacy.

In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Sarangi defeated two bigwigs – sitting MP Rabindra Kumar Jena and Nabajyoti Patnaik, son of then state Congress chief Niranjan Patnaik – to win by over 12,000 votes while five years later, he defeated his former party colleague Lekhasree Samantasinghar, who had crossed over to the BJD, and former Union minister Srikant Jena to win by over 1 lakh votes.

In his 2024 election affidavit, Sarangi declared moveable assets of Rs 45.5 lakh and immovable assets of Rs 4.3 lakh. His sources of income are pension and agriculture and he has nine criminal cases against him.

In 1999, when Australian Christian missionary Graham Staines and his two children were allegedly burnt to death in Keonjhar by activists of the Bajrang Dal, Sarangi was the state president of the organisation and deposed before the Wadhwa Commission as a witness in the case saying the main accused Dara Singh was not associated with the Bajrang Dal. Sarangi also served as a senior member of the state VHP unit.

In 2002, the Odisha Police arrested Sarangi on charges of rioting, arson, assault, and damaging government property after Hindu right-wing groups, including the Bajrang Dal, attacked the Orissa Assembly.

Before he became an MP, Sarangi was a two-time MLA. In 2004, he was elected as a BJP candidate and later as an Independent in 2009 from Nilagiri Vidhan Sabha constituency under the Balasore Lok Sabha seat.

Mukesh Rajput
A three-time MP from Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh, Rajput (55) is seen as among the more prominent Lodh leaders of the state, handpicked by former CM Kalyan Singh.

Seen as close to Singh, Rajput followed the former CM out of the BJP in 2009 and was appointed as the state vice-president of his Jan Kranti Party. He later twice served as the district panchayat president of Farrukhabad between 2000 and 2012.

Rajput emerged as a giant killer in 2014 after defeating sitting MP and former Union minister Salman Khurshid, who finished fourth. Five years later, Rajput defeated BSP candidate Manoj Agarwal and Khurshid, who this time finished second runner-up.

In the recent Lok Sabha polls, Rajput won again, but this time he defeated the SP’s Naval Kishore Shakya by only a wafer-thin margin of just over 2,000 votes.

According to his election affidavit, Rajput has no criminal case against him and has movable assets worth Rs 1.6 crore and immovable assets worth Rs 7.8 crore.

In Parliament, he has served as a member of many committees like the Local Area Development Scheme and the Standing Committee on Agriculture.","BJP MPs Pratap Chandra Sarangi and Mukesh Rajput were injured in a scuffle with Opposition MPs during a protest over the B R Ambedkar issue. Prime Minister Modi called to inquire about their health, with Rajput reportedly in ICU. Sarangi, a two-time MP from Odisha, is known for his austere image, while Rajput, a three-time MP from Uttar Pradesh, has been a prominent leader from the Lodh community. Both MPs have had notable political careers with Sarangi involved in Hindu right-wing groups and Rajput emerging as a significant figure in Farrukhabad.",Politics,91,600

Dr Rina disclosed it during a state-level workshop recently on ‘Counselling essentials and mental health needs of children in child care institutions (CCI) of Arunachal Pradesh’.

If a large part of the population indulges in it, then how can the state progress? Almost every family is today battling this problem. Society will degrade and it will have a wider effect on the growth of the state. There is a need for debate and discussion among the civil society bodies on how to tackle it. The government agencies will not be able to end it. Substance abuse is happening because people are getting easy access to drugs. How to tackle this is the main issue. For this, everyone will have to come together and work.","Arunachal Pradesh is among the top four states in India for psychoactive substance abuse, as reported by Director of Health Services Dr. Riken Rina.

After experiencing a slowdown late last year and early this year, the demand for skilled IT talent is now on the rise, making it crucial for businesses to strategize their hiring plans for the upcoming year, according to the report by Indeed, a global hiring platform.

Companies are actively hiring for roles such as application developer, software engineer, full-stack developer, senior software engineer, and PHP developer. There is also a growing demand for .NET developers, software architects, DevOps engineers, data engineers, and front-end developers.

“The IT sector consistently stands as a powerhouse, and recently there was a lull in hiring owing to recessions and companies exercising caution but now there will be an uptick in hiring, with Global Capability Centers (GCCs) being significant contributors to this uptick”, said Sashi Kumar, Head of Sales at Indeed.

Nearly 70 per cent of all tech jobs are currently software roles. The dominance of software positions is driven by several interconnected factors. As businesses increasingly rely on software for operational efficiency and innovation, the demand for developers to create and maintain essential systems has grown significantly.

Additionally, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and Blockchain technologies have amplified the need for specialised software development, keeping companies competitive, the report mentioned.

The thriving tech startup ecosystem also plays a vital role, as new ventures prioritise hiring developers to build and scale their products.

Moreover, the ongoing need for updates, security patches, and new features in existing software ensures a steady demand for professionals who can keep pace with evolving user needs and technological advancements, the findings showed.","The IT sector is expected to experience an 8.5% growth in jobs by 2025, driven by increased hiring by Global Capability Centers (GCCs).

Over 20 flights operated by Indian carriers—both domestic and international—received bomb threats this week. 
On Monday, three international flights were targeted, followed by 10 more on Tuesday, and at least six additional threats the next day. All the threats, which were shared via social media platforms, were declared fake after security checks. Central intelligence agencies quickly initiated an investigation, requesting X (formerly Twitter) to provide the IP addresses linked to the posts and to deactivate the associated accounts, according to a source.
“We have received the preliminary reports and they have informed us that posts were made from three separate handles. Of these three handles, they have traced two IP addresses; two common IPs from London and Deutschland. The users have tweeted after using a virtual private network or VPN – an encrypted connection over the Internet between a device and a remote server that’s aimed at masking one’s online identity. Details of another handle are still awaited,” a source said.
Central intelligence agencies in touch with X
After receiving initial responses, Central intelligence agencies have requested additional specific details from X and are awaiting further information, according to a source.
According to Usha Rangnani, Deputy Commissioner of Police for IGI Airport, the IGI Airport Police handled seven incidents of reported bomb threats this month, all of which were confirmed to be hoaxes after thorough verification and inspection. Legal action has been initiated against those responsible to prevent future misuse and ensure the safety and security of passengers and airport operations.
Rangnani also informed that an FIR has been filed under sections 217 and 351 (4) of the BNS, as well as section 3 (1) (d) of the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against Safety of Civil Aviation Act, 1982, related to the recent hoax bomb threat targeting an Akasa Air flight. A detailed investigation is currently underway, with coordination from the relevant social media platform.
Government unveils strict aviation regulations
Meanwhile, senior officials from the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA) are considering stricter regulations to enforce harsher penalties for individuals responsible for such threats, potentially including placing them on the no-fly list for Indian carriers. The Centre is also working with the Union Ministry of Home Affairs and the law ministry while reviewing anti-hoax measures implemented in other countries.","After multiple bomb threats to over 20 Indian flights, intelligence agencies traced IP addresses to London and Germany.

Days after the Muzaffarnagar Police asked all eateries along the Kanwar Yatra route to display their owners’ names, the Uttar Pradesh government on Friday extended the controversial order across the state.

Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said similar instructions are already in place in his state as well.

In a post on X, Sibal said, “Kanwar Yatra Route. UP directs eateries including roadside carts to display names of owners! Is this the route to a ‘Viksit Bharat’?” “Divisive agendas will only divide the country!” the former Congress leader and Independent Rajya Sabha MP said.

Addressing a press conference here, Sibal said the politics that is happening on Kanwar Yatra is not going to take India towards becoming ‘Viksit Bharat’.
The Prime Minister, Home Minister and Chief Ministers should not raise such issues on which politics is done, that lead to controversies. The common person has nothing to do with these issues. What will happen is that the row will escalate, traders would suffer losses.

Pant was in a fierce form reaching his half-century in just 54 balls and sealing the milestone with a boundary.

However, things took a turn when the second new ball was introduced, causing Pant and Sarfaraz Khan to struggle. The Kiwi bowlers tested Pant's patience with the new ball, but after facing 24 deliveries Pant shifted gears with Tim Southee on the attack.

Southee's first delivery was outside the leg stump, tempting Pant to glance at it but he missed. The Kiwi wicket-keeper Tom Blundell failed to grab the ball as well. Southee then bowled a short-length delivery which Pant successfully defended against.During the third ball, Southee came around the stump and Pant smashed the ball out of the stadium. Pant, who was batting in the 90s played the shot aggressively. He went down on one knee and slog-swept the ball over square leg for a massive 107-meter six. The audacious shot left the New Zealand players stunned in Bengaluru. Glenn Phillips and Daryl Mitchell were visibly shocked after witnessing Pant's powerful six.Rishabh Pant narrowly missed out on achieving a record-breaking seventh century during his innings. Unfortunately, he was dismissed on an unlucky 99, marking the seventh time he has been dismissed in the nervous 90s.

India defeated South Africa by seven runs in an engaging final to end a trophy drought that stretched for over a decade.

""I am completely lost and can't say what kind of emotions I am going through. Can't explain it in words. Let this sink in. Last night, I couldn't sleep as I was desperate and wanted it so badly. But I managed myself well inside the ground,"" Rohit said after becoming the third India captain after Kapil Dev and Mahendra Singh Dhoni to clinch a global title.

""Hard to sum up what we've been through in last three-four years. A lot behind the scenes, not what we did today, it's what we did before,"" said the skipper.

 Virat Kohli announces T20I retirement after India’s World Cup win over South Africa

He hasn't forgotten about the ODI World Cup defeat last year and knew that pressure needed to be soaked in.

""A lot of high-pressure games, and we've been on the wrong side of it. Guys understand when the pressure is on, what needs to be done, today was perfect example, we stuck together with backs to the wall."" The 37-year-old didn't forget to credit the team management and his fellow players for responding to his call.

""We wanted this really bad, a lot of minds need to come together, very proud of the bunch of boys and the management, giving us the liberty to play and that trust. Starts from management, coach, captain, and the players.""

Virat Kohli's form
I had no doubt about Kohli's form. He has played with Virat Kohli for more than 15 years and was confident that his poor run of form in the lead up to the final wasn't a headache.

""No-one was in doubt about the form of Virat, on top of his game for last 15 years. Come the occasion, big players stand up. Crucial to hold that end, for the others to play around him.

""...it wasn't a wicket to bat freely. He did that perfectly, that experience of all the years come together, and Axar's batting was crucial,"" he said, lauding the 47-run effort by Patel.

Don't know how Bumrah does it day in day out. Pace spearhed Jasprit Bumrah's skills are difficult to describe for a commoner but even the skipper feels that he is ill-equipped to sum up his artistry.

""Jasprit, I understand you guys trying to put it into words, but I don't know how he does it, it's just masterclass. He backs his skills which is more than enough, and is a confident lad. Class act,"" Rohit said about the player of the tournament.

Hardik was brilliant
After a rough IPL for Mumbai Indians, Hardik Pandya had a great T20 World Cup and his national skipper acknowledged the performance.

""Hardik was brilliant, to bowl that last over, proud of the boys. And the fans, from New York to Barbados, and back home. Late in India but they've been waiting a long time. Very proud of what we've achieved today."" As the skipper took a lap of honour with his daughter Samaira on his shoulders, the sense of contentment and elation was writ large on his face. Rohit Sharma deserved every bit of it.","Rohit Sharma, emotional after India's second T20 World Cup win, attributed their success not just to perfect execution on the final day but to years of quiet preparation.

The Arunachal Times,2024-08-01 00:00:00,Asiatic black bear undergo surgery at Itanagar Biological Park,"ITANAGAR, 31 Jul: An Asiatic black bear recently underwent eye surgery at the Itanagar Biological Park. The adult male bear had partial corneal opacity due to old age and an infection in the left eye caused by maggots. After following the due protocol and assessing the severity of the condition, the authorities decided to proceed with the surgery.

A team of veterinary doctors, including Dr. Sorang Tadap, veterinary officer of the Biological Park, and Dr. Nido Tayo MVSc (Surgery & Radiology), senior veterinary officer from the department of animal husbandry, veterinary and dairy development, performed the surgery. “The surgery lasted for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Sedation was smooth, and recovery has been very fast. Tarsorrhaphy was performed. The bear is now gradually recovering from the eye infection,” informed Dr. Tadap.

In June of this year, a team of veterinarians performed surgery on a tigress named Chippi at the biological park. At that time, Dr. Sorang Tadap and Dr. Nido Tayo, along with Dr. Panjit Basumatary from the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), removed two large tumorous masses from Chippi’s neck region. Since then, Chippi has made a recovery. Dr. Sorang Tadap is the sole veterinarian working in wildlife conservation in the state. In addition to his regular duties at the biological park, he travels across the state to address wildlife issues such as rescue, treatment, rehabilitation and raising orphaned or abandoned wildlife. Dr. Nido Tayo, a very senior veterinarian with over two decades of experience in veterinary surgery, also contributes significantly to these efforts.","An Asiatic black bear underwent eye surgery at the Itanagar Biological Park due to partial corneal opacity and maggot infection.

The Statesman ,2024-10-13 00:00:00,"Baba Siddique murder: Accused met Lawrence Bishnoi gang in Haryana jail, say police","Weeks ahead of the Maharashtra Assembly polls, the murder of former minister and NCP leader Baba Siddique has sent shockwaves across the state, triggering a political firestorm and raising serious concerns about the law and order situation in the country’s commercial capital.

Sixty-six-year-old Siddique was shot at by three assailants when he was getting into his car outside his son’s office in Bandra. He was rushed to Lilavati Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

Given the NCP leader’s close ties with actor Salman Khan, the police confirmed it is also probing this angle too.There were three people at the spot of incidence. Two have been caught and one is absconding… 15 teams of the Crime Branch are on the job. The angles of Lawrence Bishnoi, Salman Khan, or any other angle is being investigated,” stated DCP Crime Branch Datta Nalawade.

The Mumbai Police arrested two suspects on the spot and registered a case under various sections of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), the Arms Act, and the Maharashtra Police Act.

The two accused — Gurmail Singh and Dharmaraj Kashyap — were presented before a holiday court. The court has remanded Singh in police custody until October 21 and ordered age verification of Kashyap. An ossification test has also been ordered to determine whether he is a minor.

Preliminary investigation has revealed that the murder was meticulously planned, and further inquiries are being conducted to ascertain if the assailants intended to target any other individuals, especially with the Maharashtra polls approaching.The police have also identified two more accused, namely, Mohammed Zeeshan Akhtar and Shivkumar Gautam. They both are still at large, with police teams dispatched to multiple locations, including Haryana, Pune, Delhi, and Ujjain, to track them down.

The shooters were hired on a contract worth between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh. The police are investigating whether they received special training and are also probing who funded the operation, sources said.

According to the sources, the accused had been living in a rented apartment in Kurla for over a month before executing the crime.

The initial investigation has also revealed that the three shooters — Singh, Kashyap, and Gautam — previously met in jail, where they allegedly came in contact with a member of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang in Haryana.

Yesterday, between 9-9.30 pm, ex-state minister Baba Siddique was shot outside his sons’ office, under Nirmal Nagar police station. An offence has been registered and the investigation has been handed over to the Crime Branch. Two accused were detained on the spot… Two pistols and 28 rounds have been recovered… We have the custody of the accused till October 21. We are investigating the Lawrence Bishnoi gang’s role in the case…,” said

Meanwhile, the Opposition has mounted its attack on the Eknath Shinde-led Mahayuti alliance government and demanded it should be dismissed immediately.

Shiv Sena (UBT) spokesperson Anand Dubey said, “Baba Siddique was not just a former minister, he was a beloved figure in Mumbai. The state government had provided him with security, and yet they failed to protect him,”

Amid the Opposition’s criticism, the chief minister has given instructions to bury Siddiqui with state honors. He also said that the murder trial will take place in a fast-track court, and handed the investigation of the killing to ‘encounter specialist’ Daya Nayak.

“Gang wars should not revive. Strict action should be taken against those who indulge in such incidents,” he said.","Former minister and NCP leader Baba Siddique was shot dead by three assailants in Bandra, Mumbai, weeks before the Maharashtra Assembly polls, sparking political outrage and concerns about law and order.

The shooters were reportedly hired for Rs 2.5-3 lakh, and the police are probing possible connections to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, as well as funding sources.

The investigation, now led by encounter specialist Daya Nayak, aims to determine if the murder was part of a broader plot, especially given Siddique's ties with actor Salman Khan. The Opposition has criticized the state government for failing to protect Siddique, who had official security.

The Hindu,2024-11-18 00:00:00,Growing epidemic: On diabetes and India,"From around 200 million in 1990, the number of people with diabetes has quadrupled globally to over 800 million in 2022 while the global diabetes prevalence in adults rose from 7% to 14% between 1990 and 2022, as in data released in The Lancet on November 13. At 212 million, India has the highest number of people with diabetes as against China’s prevalence of 148 million. India also topped the list of countries with 133 million people over the age of 30 years with untreated diabetes as against 78 million in China. One reason for the steep increase in the number of those with diabetes was the methodology used for pooling and analysing the data — being on medication for diabetes, or having a fasting plasma glucose of 7·0 mmol/L or more, or an HbA1c of 6·5% or more. Unlike earlier studies that mostly relied on elevated fasting plasma glucose or other single-biomarker data, the analysis by the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration with support from the World Health Organization (WHO) included people whose fasting plasma glucose or glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was elevated. Taking into account elevated fasting plasma glucose alone without including those with elevated glycated haemoglobin, the study notes, misses out many people with diabetes, particularly in south Asia. That diabetes prevalence in India has increased in the last three decades is beyond doubt even if the absolute numbers are contested.","The controversy surrounding Governor R.N. Ravi's address to the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly has indeed become a recurring issue. For the third consecutive year, Governor Ravi has sparked controversy by leaving the Assembly without delivering his address, citing the absence of the national anthem before his speech as an insult to the Constitution and the national anthem2.

The State government maintains that the practice in the Assembly is to play the State’s invocation to Tamil before the address and the national anthem at the end of the Governor’s speech, a practice that was communicated to the Governor's office. This disagreement has led to accusations that Governor Ravi is politicizing the event and avoiding his constitutional duty to present the government's policy statement1.

In previous years, Governor Ravi has also skipped portions of the address prepared by the State government, including references to the 'Dravidian model of governance' and praise for the law and order situation in the State. Last year, he cited ""misleading claims and facts"" as his reason for not reading out the address2.",Opinion and Editorial,175,232

We have seen approximately a 15 to 20% increase in the number of patients who have come with worsening respiratory problems, patients who have pre-existing asthma, we are seeing a lot more patients with asthma exacerbation,” Madan told ANI. 

-The government is still struggling to curb stubble burning cases in Delhi and neighbouring areas. To curb these cases amid rising air pollution, the Centre on Wednesday amended the COmmission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) rules for the National Capital Region and adjoining areas, reported Mint earlier. The Union Government has increased the penalty on stubble burning to up to ₹30,000.

-The pollution levels in the national capital surged significantly over the past few days. The rise in Delhi air pollution coincides with Chhath Puja celebration which requires devotees to stay outside their homes throughout night making them vulnerable to poor AQI.

-Delhi's real-time AQI remained at 377 at 7 am on Friday, November 8, according to www.aqi.in. The Central Pollution Control Board had recorded Delhi AQI at 382 at 6 pm.

-Sixteen weather stations recorded an AQI above 400 with seven more stations seeing the air quality deteriorate to a ""severe"" level by evening.

Business Standard,2024-09-04 00:00:00,India provided more climate finance than many rich nations in 2022: Report,"India contributed $ 1.28 billion in climate finance through multilateral development banks (MDBs) in 2022, surpassing the contributions of many developed countries, according to a new analysis.

The analysis, conducted by the UK-based think tank ODI and the Zurich Climate Resilience Alliance, comes amid a renewed push by some developed countries to broaden the donor base for climate finance to include developing countries like China and Saudi Arabia.

The report reveals that only 12 developed countries provided their fair share of international climate finance in 2022. These countries are -- Norway, France, Luxembourg, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Japan, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium and Finland.

Researchers noted that the significant gap in climate finance is largely due to the United States failing to contribute its fair share. Australia, Spain, Canada and the United Kingdom also performed relatively poorly in this regard.

The analysis has identified the top 30 non-Annex II countries that provided substantial climate finance to developing countries in 2022 through multilateral contributions to development banks and climate funds.

This group includes former economies in transition like Poland and Russia, countries that have achieved high-income status since 1992, such as Chile, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, and middle-income countries with large populations, including Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines and Pakistan.

India provided $ 1.287 billion in climate finance to other developing countries through MDBs in 2022, a sum larger than what was contributed by some developed countries like Greece ($ 0.23 billion), Portugal ($ 0.23 billion), Ireland ($ 0.3 billion) and New Zealand ($ 0.27 billion).
China provided $ 2.52 billion in climate finance through MDBs in 2022, Brazil gave $ 1.135 billion, South Korea $ 1.13 billion and Argentina $ 1.01 billion.

According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), adopted in 1992, high-income, industrialised countries (referred to as Annex-II countries) are responsible for providing finance and technology to help developing countries combat and adapt to climate change. These countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and European Union (EU) member states, such as Germany, France and the UK, have historically benefitted from industrialisation and contributed the most to greenhouse gas emissions.

At COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, these developed countries pledged to jointly provide $ 100 billion each year by 2020 to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. However, this target has not been fully met, leading to a significant finance gap. This shortfall has eroded trust and hindered climate action in developing countries.

In May, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) claimed that developed countries had met the long-standing $ 100 billion-a-year promise by providing nearly $ 116 billion in climate finance to developing countries in 2022, with nearly 70 per cent of the money given in the form of loans.

The ODI researchers pointed out that many developed countries, despite performing well in terms of climate-finance contributions, would make ""markedly less progress towards meeting their fair share if the finance provided was accounted for on grant-equivalence terms"" -- in other words, if it reflected their real fiscal effort.

The report calls for the inclusion of a ""burden-sharing mechanism"" in the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) to provide clarity on each country's obligations and hold countries accountable.

The NCQG refers to the new, larger amount that developed nations must mobilise annually, starting 2025, to support climate action in developing countries. Countries are expected to finalise the NCQG at this year's UN climate conference -- COP29 -- in Baku, Azerbaijan in November.

The current $ 100 billion annual climate-finance goal is a collective commitment by developed countries. Its collective nature has meant that individual developed countries are not accountable for specific sums of money, potentially reducing the overall amount of climate finance provided due to the lack of individual scrutiny.

The inclusion of a burden-sharing arrangement among developed countries could potentially strengthen the NCQG by fostering greater accountability and trust among parties, according to the ODI researchers.

Many developing countries, including India, have recently advocated for such an arrangement to enhance accountability among developed countries.","In 2022, India contributed $1.28 billion in climate finance through multilateral development banks (MDBs), surpassing many developed countries, according to a report by the ODI and Zurich Climate Resilience Alliance.

India's contribution exceeded those of countries like Greece and New Zealand. China, Brazil, and South Korea were also among non-Annex II nations providing substantial climate finance.

This comes as developed countries have yet to meet their $100 billion annual climate finance pledge from COP15 in 2009, eroding trust and slowing progress in climate action. The report calls for a ""burden-sharing mechanism"" within the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), expected to be finalized at COP29 in November 2024, to ensure greater accountability and clarity on climate finance obligations.

Financial Express,2024-08-08 00:00:00,Prolonged instability in Bangladesh may disrupt reactive dyes industry for next one year,"The ongoing political upheaval in Bangladesh may push the Indian reactive dyes industry into a turmoil for at least six months. Industry experts say that the overall impact of the recent unrest may be significant in some sectors, especially dye stuff.
Nilesh Damani, Vice President, Gujarat Dyestuff Manufacturers Association, told FE, “We are hoping that there may not be any immediate impact as most of our export is halted at our international border with Bangladesh. Furthermore, most of the export already reached to Bangladesh has been paid for in LCs (letter of credit) and bonds. But if the turmoil continues for the coming months, it will put the chemical industry in Gujarat in a very challenging position.”
He also said that the association is regularly in touch with the authorities to access the real time situation. “Gujarat alone exports around 3,500 tonnes to 4,000 tonnes of reactive dyes to Bangladesh per month. This monthly export is worth around Rs 1500 crore. If this demand stops or reduces significantly, the manufacturing units in the state face serious problems because the industry is already struggling with muted international demand.”
Also Read Jubilant FoodWorks Q1 Results 2024: Date, Time, Where to Watch? He further claimed that industrial clusters like Vatva GIDC in Ahmedabad will be worst hit as around 250 units out of 674 units in Vatva are manufacturing reactive dyes.
According to industry sources, the share of exports to Bangladesh in the overall chemical industry is just around 5% but India is the source of around 30% of the total dye stuff demand in Bangladesh. And 15% of Gujarat’s total reactive dye export goes to Bangladesh.
S. K. Chaudhary, Founder Director, Safex Chemicals Group, said, “We are exporting mainly dyestuff and reactive chemicals to Bangladesh. The ripple effects of any disruption in our neighbouring country cannot be ignored.”

Indian Express,2024-12-28 00:00:00,"Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen airport as passenger plane lands, UN official reports","The United Nations has condemned Israeli airstrikes on Yemen’s Sanaa airport, which struck as a civilian Airbus 320 with hundreds of passengers was landing and a UN delegation was preparing to leave. Speaking on Friday, Julien Harneis, the UN’s top humanitarian official in Yemen, described the incident as “a terrifying experience”, as reported by Associated Press (AP).

Harneis said the airstrikes on Thursday destroyed the airport’s control tower while a Yemenia Airways plane was taxiing. “Thankfully, the plane landed safely, and passengers disembarked. But it could have been much worse,” he said, addressing reporters in a video conference from Sanaa.Two airstrikes hit approximately 300 metres south and north of the VIP lounge, where Harneis and 15 others, including WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, were waiting. “We had no warning of any potential airstrikes, and daytime bombings in Sanaa are extremely rare,” Harneis said.

The strikes killed at least three people and injured dozens, including a UN Humanitarian Air Service crew member, who suffered severe leg injuries from shrapnel. The injured man was rushed to a Sanaa hospital for surgery before being flown to Jordan.
UN security officials evacuated the delegation to armoured vehicles, where they waited for 40 minutes before moving to safety. Harneis noted that the delegation spent the night at a UN compound, and the following day, the UN team, including the injured crew member, departed for Jordan on a flight without an operating control tower.

Israel’s military stated it was unaware of the UN delegation’s presence at the airport. The strikes, they claimed, targeted facilities used by Houthi rebels and Iran. Harneis refuted this, saying, “Sanaa airport is a civilian facility used by the UN and for humanitarian flights, including one vital Yemenia flight to and from Amman”, reported by AP.

Yemen, embroiled in a decade-long civil war, has seen Houthi rebels escalate attacks on Israel following the October 7 assault by Hamas. The Houthis have targeted ships in the Red Sea and launched drones and missiles at Israel, prompting intensified Israeli military responses.Israeli strikes have also damaged Yemen’s key port of Hodeida, critical for importing 80% of the nation’s food and over 90% of its medical supplies. Harneis reported that an earlier strike destroyed tugboats, and is estimated to have reduced the harbor’s capacity by 50%, the UN official said, while damage from Thursday’s airstrikes hasn’t been assessed yet.","The United Nations condemned Israeli airstrikes on Yemen's Sanaa airport, which targeted the airport's control tower as a civilian Airbus 320 was landing and a UN delegation was preparing to leave.

We need the same spirit to achieve the goal of developed India,” he said in his monthly radio broadcast Mann ki Baat. Reiterating the need for non-dynasts to join politics, Modi said he has received a tremendous response from the younger demographic to his suggestion of bringing 100,000 youngsters from non-political families and backgrounds into politics.

In his Independence Day address on August 15, the PM had said there is a need to give platform to talented youth and fresh blood in politics to pave the way for ending “casteism and dynasty politics.” 

“I spoke about the need to bring about one lakh (100,000) people to politics. There is a strong response to this. This shows that many youth are ready to enter politics. They only need the right opportunity and guidance,” the PM said.The PM has in the past attacked dynastic politics and lashed out at parties that reserve positions of power within the party and, when in government, for their kin. 

Underlining the need to usher in changes, which he said have the support of the youth, he said, “Many have written that it is indeed unimaginable for them... Despite their willingness, they are unable to enter politics, as they have no political legacy. Some youngsters have written that they have a good experience of working at the grassroots level, which can help in solving problems, but they have written that family politics suppresses talent.”

Their experience and enthusiasm will be helpful for the country.” ","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Mann ki Baat radio address, emphasized the importance of involving youth from non-political backgrounds in mainstream politics to drive India's development.

She emphasizes that frequent elections in India, unlike other countries, hinder her work as an MP due to the model code of conduct enforcement.

Malini argues that simultaneous elections would conserve resources, which could then be allocated to vital sectors like education and health. This perspective resonates with concerns about the economic burden of frequent elections.

""In every country, elections are held only once, not like India where we have elections all the time. Due to this, I face a lot of problems as an MP when work stops due to the enforcement of the model code of conduct.

The bill proposes a 'One Nation One Election' or simultaneous elections to both Lok Sabha and state assemblies. The bill will be sent to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for detailed discussions.

The Speaker of the Lok Sabha announced the result of the vote on the introduction of the bill in the House. The vote showed 269 members in favor (Ayes) and 196 against (Noes). This followed Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal's formal introduction of the Constitution (129th Amendment) Bill, 2024, on 'One Nation, One Election' and his agreement to send the bill to a JPC in response to Union Home Minister Amit Shah's statement.Meanwhile, Congress MP Manish Tewari opposed the move, arguing, ""Beyond the seventh schedule of the Constitution is the basic structure doctrine, which spells out that there are certain features of the Constitution beyond the amending power of the House. The essential features are federalism and the structure of our democracy. Therefore, the bills moved by the Minister of Law and Justice are an absolute assault on the basic structure of the Constitution and are beyond the legislative competence of the House.""

Taut, tense, and tragic, director Hansal Mehta turns a formula into a formidable experience with a superb Kareena Kapoor Khan in tow

An intriguing murder mystery layered with apposite social commentary, The Buckingham Murders (TBM) is a fast-paced thriller that makes us reflect on the social churn. Fuelled by the powerhouse talent of Kareena Kapoor Khan and fine-tuned by writer-director Hansal Mehta’s empathetic gaze, the film genuinely attempts to understand the social outcasts within the framework of the genre.

Who are these young boys who shoot indiscriminately in public places in the affluent American and European suburbs? How is it that personal acrimony is taking a communal turn even in the so-called melting pots of the world? Who are these housewives who keep drudging to keep dead marriages and male ego alive? From Shahid and Omerta to Faraaz, Mehta seems to have this urge to understand the psyche of people whom we summarily ostracise or stereotype without listening to their side of the story. InTBM, without romanticising their actions, Mehta maps the troubled mindscapes on both sides of the law to probe how humanity crumbles, faith gives way, and demons seep through the crevices in conscience.

Today, 4th January, marks the start of the application process for these coveted positions, igniting fierce competition within the party.

Key cities such as Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot are witnessing a flurry of activity as both current and former office bearers vie for the top posts. The selection process has triggered intense lobbying, with contenders jostling for influence and dominance.

Tensions came to a head in Vadodara, where a public clash between a former deputy mayor and a former corporator over the city president post has grabbed headlines. A video of their heated confrontation has since gone viral, adding further drama to the selection process.

The simmering feud within Vadodara city BJP erupted during today’s (4th January) candidate sensitisation process. As application forms were being accepted at the city BJP office, a heated exchange broke out between Sunita Shukla, Vice President of BJP Mahila Morcha, and former corporator Gopi Talati.

Shukla accused Talati of making a statement demeaning to women, while Talati countered, claiming the allegations were an attempt to undermine his candidacy.

""Dirty comments about women have been made,"" alleged Sunitaben Shukla, Vice President of Vadodara City Mahila Morcha. Speaking to the media, she stated, ""I will first brief the president personally before addressing the media. Any further action will follow the president's approval."" Emphasising discipline, she added, ""In a party like BJP, ask what has been said—not me. As a woman, if something inappropriate happens at this office, I must speak up.""

Shukla hinted that the issue could escalate, saying, ""The matter will be discussed with the president and may reach the high command.""

“I haven’t spoken about any worker; the allegations are baseless,” said former corporator and presidential aspirant Gopi Talati. He claimed the accusations stem from fears over his challenge to the current president.

“They’re making dirty allegations because my candidacy is strong,” he added. Pointing fingers at his accusers, he remarked, “Everyone, including Sunitaben, knows who is behind this.” Talati emphasised his adherence to party procedures, stating, “I have filed my candidacy as per the rules, and anyone has the right to make allegations.”

Arteta enjoyed a successful 18-month loan spell at PSG while still he was still a teenager at Barcelona.

Though the Dortmund team appears to have adapted to the new competition format very well - last season’s beaten finalist has 10 goals from two games after starting with a 3-0 win over Club Brugge - its fans made their opposition to the reforms clear with a huge tifo slamming UEFA.

This season UEFA changed the structure of Europe’s premier competition to add four more teams. The group stage was scrapped for a league system with each of the now 36 participating teams playing eight opponents once in a first phase of the competition.

UEFA claimed the changes would ensure more evenly matched games, but Tuesday’s results - the big wins for Barca, City and Dortmund - appear to belie that claim.

There were more big wins Tuesday with Inter Milan defeating Red Star Belgrade 4-0, and tournament debutant Brest routing Salzburg 4-0 away for its second win in as many games in Europe’s premier competition.

Iran forward Mehdi Taremi struck a penalty past Israel and Red Star goalkeeper Omri Glazer and set up two more goals for Inter hours after his country launched a barrage of missiles at Israel.

Senegalese forward Abdallah Sima netted twice for Brest to take his tally to three goals in two games after he scored in the French team’s tournament-opening 2-1 win over Austrian champion Sturm Graz.

Also Tuesday, Bayer Leverkusen defeated AC Milan 1-0 in Germany thanks a well-worked move finished by Victor Boniface.

Daniel Bragança scored late to earn Sporting Lisbon a 1-1 draw at PSV Eindhoven.

Kaan Kairinen’s brilliant free kick was enough for Prague to draw 1-1 at Stuttgart.

Stuttgart fans displayed a huge choreography saying “Back in Europe” behind one of the goals. It was the German team’s first Champions League match at home since a 1-1 draw with Barcelona in February 2010.","Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, and Manchester City have all secured their first wins in the restructured Champions League. Dortmund scored a hat trick in a 7-1 win against Celtic, while Barcelona and Manchester City secured their first wins. Inter Milan and Brest also secured victories, while Bayer Leverkusen defeated AC Milan. The new competition format, which added four more teams, was met with opposition from UEFA, who claimed it would ensure more evenly matched games.",Sports,74,504

The Hindu,2024-06-29 00:00:00,Bengal BJP leaders allege female worker was assaulted in ‘post poll violence’,"The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged on Friday that a female leader of the party’s Minority Morcha was beaten up by Trinamool Congress supporters in the Cooch Behar district.

Leader of the Opposition, Suvendu Adhikari, said a party colleague belonging to a minority community was attacked and wrote to the National Human Rights Commission, the National Commission for Women, and the National Commission for Minorities urging each to send a team to West Bengal.

In his communication to the quasi-judicial bodies, Mr. Adhikari described the incident as an “example of post poll violence” and alleged that “she was dragged by her hair and subjected to severe physical assault, and her dress was torn in broad daylight by TMC goons on June 25, 2024.”

“She is at present admitted to hospital. The police are not taking any action against the accused,” he alleged.

BJP inquiry team
West Bengal BJP president Sukanata Majumdar also took note of the incident and has constituted a seven-member team led by MLA Agnimitra Paul, who will inquire into the incident. The team will visit Cooch Behar today and submit a report to the State BJP president.

The Trinamool Congress leadership in Cooch Behar district described the allegations as politically motivated and said that the attack on the woman was the result of a property dispute.

BJP candidate Nisith Paramanik lost the Cooch Behar Lok Sabha seat in north Bengal to the TMC‘s Jagadish Chandra Basunia in the Lok Sabha polls by a margin of over 39,000 votes. Several allegations of post poll violence were made by BJP supporters, including some from the Muslim community. The Lok Sabha seat borders Assam and, before the general elections, was considered a stronghold of the BJP.

CAPF deployment
In another development, a central team of the BJP that visited the State and inquired into allegations of post poll violence submitted a report to party president J.P. Nadda on Friday.

The BJP MP team led by Biplab Deb recommended extending the deployment of central armed police force (CAPF) units, localising the deployment of the CAPF, and securing BJP offices.

The team said that the various commissions should take cognisance of these incidents, visit the areas, and award compensation to those affected. The team has recommended punitive action against bureaucrats who act as facilitators and financial assistance to families that are severely affected.","The West Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused supporters of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of assaulting a female leader from the party’s Minority Morcha in Cooch Behar district.

West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar has formed a seven-member team to investigate the incident. Meanwhile, TMC leaders attribute the attack to a property dispute and dismiss the allegations as politically motivated.

The decision came after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah considered the two banks’ requests.

A government circular on August 12 ordered all its departments, boards, corporations, public sector units and universities to withdraw all their deposits and investments in the SBI and the PNB and stop transacting any business with these institutions.

In a post on social media platform X, Rahul Gandhi said, “The Mysuru-Darbhanga train accident mirrors the horrific Balasore accident -- a passenger train colliding with a stationary goods train. Despite many lives lost in numerous accidents, no lessons are learned. Accountability starts at the top. How many more families must be destroyed before this government wakes up?”

In his post, the opposition leader said that the Kavaraipettai accident that happened on Friday night reflects the Balasore (Odisha) tragedy of June 2, 2023, in which 290 people lost their lives and more than 900 were injured.

It may be recalled that 19 passengers of the Bagmati Express, which derailed at Kavaraipettai Railway Station in Tamil Nadu, have been admitted to the hospital.

The condition of four passengers is reported to be serious. Southern Railway has already launched a high-level probe into the accident.

The Bagmati Express train, running from Mysuru to Darbhanga in Bihar, collided with a stationary goods train at 8:30 p.m. on Friday.

The impact caused 12 coaches of the Bagmati Express to derail, and a parcel van of the train caught fire, which was later extinguished by fire and rescue services.

The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) promptly reached the scene and conducted rescue operations.

Sources within the Railways told IANS that the accident occurred due to a signal failure. Train No. 12578, the Mysuru-Darbhanga Express, had been given a green signal to pass through the main line.

However, the train, travelling at 75 km/h, entered the loop line and collided with the rear of a goods train stationed there.

The Express train had crossed Ponneri railway station at 8:27 p.m. and was given a green signal to pass through the next station, Kavaraipettai, via the main line.

A statement from Southern Railway said, “While entering Kavaraipettai station, the train crew experienced a heavy jerk, and instead of proceeding onto the main line as signalled, the train entered the loop line at 75 km/h and collided with the goods train.

“Railway officials confirmed that the crew was unharmed, and the fire in the parcel van was successfully put out. “So far, no casualties have been reported, but some injuries have occurred. All the injured have been taken to nearby hospitals,” an official said.

Tiruvallur district collector, T. Prabushankar, told media persons that 1,360 passengers were on board the Bagmati Express during the collision, and 19 passengers were injured but there were no casualties.

Train movement on both sides of the section was affected, and alternative arrangements were being made for the transportation of passengers.","Rahul Gandhi, the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, criticized the Indian Railways and the central government over the recent derailment of the Mysore-Darbhanga Bagmati Express.

Hindustan Times,2024-09-06 00:00:00,Ashwin sorry for Pakistan legends after Bangladesh whitewash: ‘They haven’t won a Test at home in over 1000 days’,"India all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin felt sorry for the geats of the Pakistan cricket team after their team slumped to a new low, suffering a whitewash against Bangladesh at home. Bangladesh beat Pakistan in the first Test in Rawalpindi by 10 wickets to register their first win against them in the longest format of the game and then went on to beat them in the second and final Test at the same venue by six wickets to complete a historic series win. The victory in the second Test would taste sweeter to the Bangladesh side as they were 26/6 in their first innings at one stage. akistan, on the other hand, squandered its advantage to crash into yet another defeat at home. This was the 10th consecutive winless Test match at home for Pakistan. They have lost six of those and drawn four. Their last Test win at home was more than three and half years ago against South Africa in February 2021.

The result slumped their Test ranking to No.8 and their rating points to the worst since 1965.

Ashwin said it was disappointing to see the state of Pakistan cricket.

""What a victory for Bangladesh but what a disappointment for Pakistan. It's quite disappointing because Pakistan is not an easy team to beat. But more than 1000 days at home Pakistan haven't won at home. Pakistani cricket fans are passionate,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. India's second-highest wicket-taker in Tests pointed the legacy of Pakistan cricket to express his shock at the current performance. ""You know who I feel for the most? It's Pakistan cricket's history. Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram, Shoaib Akhtar, Imran Khan, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Ijaz Ahmed,, Salim Malik, Saeed Anwar, Amer Sohail... I can just keep on going. What legacy that country and their cricket team has.""

Ashwin took nothing away from Pakistan, whom he called a much-improve Test side because of mixture of youth and experience in their line-up, said it was difficult to even think of beating Pakistan like this 10 years ago.

""Of course, Bangladesh have come a long way. I don't take anything away from them. Last year, when we toured Bangladesh, we knew what a good Test side Bangladesh is. They have got a lot of experience in Shakib Al Hasan, Mushfiqur Rahim, Mehidy Hasan and they have also got some good young talent.Keeping all this aside, to see where Pakistan cricket where it is now... It was difficult to beat them even 10 years ago when Misbah, Younis Khan were there and they played their home matches in the UAE. You had the likes of Yasir Shah, you had two left-arm spinners in Adbur Rahman and Zulfiqar Babar coming in. Where they (Pakistan team) are right now, I can't believe it,"" Ashwin added.

Ashwin feels bad for Pakistan captain Shan Masood
Ashwin said he felt “terribly bad” for Pakistan captain Shan Masood, who has won all five Tests since taking over the captaincy duties from Babar Azam and pointed out possible issues in the Pakistan dressing room.","India all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin expressed disappointment over Pakistan's recent cricketing struggles after they suffered a historic whitewash at home against Bangladesh.

Indian stock market indices Sensex and Nifty continued their decline from Budget day following Nirmala Sitharaman's proposal to increase the securities transaction tax on futures and options. Foreign fund outflows and a negative global market trend also dampened sentiment in the domestic markets further.

V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said, “Now that the steep increase in STCGs tax and the marginal increase in LTCGs tax on equity is a reality, investors should focus on investing in stocks which can deliver superior returns. In the present context FMCG stocks look attractive from the valuation perspective. Watch out for stocks like ITC and United Spirits. It is important to understand that the Budget strengthens the India Growth Story with focus on growth with financial stability.”From the Sensex pack, Hindustan Unilever dropped 3 per cent after the firm reported just a 2.2 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at ₹2,612 crore for April-June FY25 impacted by price reductions.

Bajaj Finance, Nestle, HCL Technologies, UltraTech Cement, Mahindra & Mahindra and Adani Ports were the other big laggards.However, ITC, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra and NTPC were among the gainers.

The key benchmark indices ended marginally lower in volatile trade on Tuesday as the government proposed to hike the securities transaction tax on futures & options in the Budget for 2024-25.

On Tuesday, the BSE benchmark settled lower by 73.04 points or 0.09 per cent at 80,429.04. The Nifty dipped 30.20 points or 0.12 per cent to 24,479.05.","The recent downturn in the Indian stock market is indeed reflective of several key factors:

1. **Increase in Securities Transaction Tax (STT)**: The proposal to hike STT on futures and options in the Union Budget 2024-25 has been a significant concern for investors. This tax increase impacts trading strategies, especially for those involved in derivatives trading.

2. **Foreign Fund Outflows**: The continued outflow of foreign funds contributes to the negative sentiment in the market. Foreign investors' withdrawal affects liquidity and market stability.

3. **Negative Global Market Trends**: Broader global market trends also influence domestic markets. A negative global sentiment often leads to reduced investor confidence and can exacerbate local market declines.

4. **Sectoral Performance**: As noted, FMCG stocks like ITC and United Spirits are viewed as relatively attractive due to valuation perspectives, while stocks like Hindustan Unilever, Bajaj Finance, and others faced declines. The mixed performance within the Sensex pack highlights sector-specific responses to market conditions and budgetary changes.

5. **Market Indices**: The Sensex and Nifty indices showed marginal declines, with the Sensex falling by 0.09% and the Nifty by 0.12%. This reflects overall investor caution amid the changes and external factors.

The NTA also announced the answer key for the undergraduate entrance exam, paving the way for the announcement of the results, albeit delayed ""The candidates can submit their challenges for the answer key by 6 pm on July 9,"" a senior NTA official said.

""The NTA is also addressing public grievances regarding the exam conducted for CUET-UG that were received up to June 30. If a grievance is found genuine, the NTA is committed to redoing the exam for these candidates at selected centres any day between July 15 and 19,"" the official added. While the NTA officials did not comment on the grievances received by the agency, candidates claimed there was loss of time at certain exam centres and technical issues.

""Challenges made by the candidates will be verified by a panel of subject experts. Based on the revised final answer key, the result will be declared,"" the official said.

The delay in CUET-UG results comes amid a raging row over alleged irregularities in competitive exams, including NEET and NET.

The CUET-UG exam conducted in a hybrid mode for the first time across the country was cancelled in Delhi a night before the exam, citing logistical reasons. The exam was conducted in the national capital later.

The NTA had earlier announced that the third edition of CUET-UG will be completed in seven days and there will be no normalisation of scores as all exams will be conducted in a single shift.

For 15 subjects, the tests were in pen-paper mode and for the other 48 subjects, the exam was held in computer-based mode.

Over 13.4 lakh candidates registered for the common entrance test for admission to undergraduate courses in 261 central, state, deemed and private universities this year.

In the first edition of the exam in 2022, the test was plagued by technical glitches. Also, as a result of tests for a subject being conducted over multiple shifts, the scores had to be normalised during the announcement of results.

In the line of fire over alleged irregularities in the medical entrance exam NEET and the PhD entrance NET, the Centre removed NTA Director General Subodh Singh last week and notified a high-level panel headed by former Indian Space Research Organisation chief R Radhakrishnan to ensure transparent, smooth and fair conduct of examinations through the NTA.

While the NEET is under the scanner over several irregularities, including an alleged paper leak, the UGC-NET was cancelled as the education ministry received inputs that the integrity of the exam was compromised. Both matters are being probed by the CBI.

","The National Testing Agency (NTA) will potentially conduct a retest for CUET-UG candidates from July 15 to 19, pending investigation and validation of grievances raised about the exam's conduct. An official statement confirmed that challenges to the undergraduate entrance exam's answer key must be submitted by July 9, paving the way for result announcements, albeit delayed. Issues reported by candidates included time loss and technical difficulties at certain exam centers.

Challenges submitted will be reviewed by subject experts, and the final answer key will determine the result declaration. The CUET-UG exam, conducted in hybrid mode nationwide for the first time, faced logistical setbacks in Delhi but proceeded subsequently. Unlike previous editions, this year's test avoided score normalization by scheduling all exams in a single shift for its 63 subjects.

Over 13.4 lakh candidates registered for CUET-UG across 261 universities this year. The NTA's handling of exams has faced scrutiny amidst allegations of irregularities in NEET and UGC-NET exams, leading to the removal of NTA Director General Subodh Singh and the formation of a new oversight panel.

Mint,2025-01-03 00:00:00,PM Modi sounds poll bugle in Delhi; takes Sheesh Mahal swipe at Arvind Kejriwal  AAPpda ko hatana hai,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday sounded the poll bugle for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of next month's Delhi Assembly Election 2025 by launching a scathing attack on the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and its national convenor, Arvind Kejriwal. Without naming anyone, Modi accused the AAP government of pushing the national capital into a disaster in the last 10 years of its rule.
Modi accused the AAP government of blocking Union government's benefits for people of the national capital and took an indirect swipe at Arvind Kejriwal for building a Sheesh Mahal for himself while he was the chief minister of Delhi.
""In the last 10 years, Delhi has been surrounded by an 'AAPda' (disaster). By keeping Anna Hazare at the front, a few dishonest people have pushed Delhi towards a disaster. People of Delhi have pledged that they will no more tolerate this AAPda ...,"" the prime minister said using an AAP pun while addressing a public meeting at Ashok Vihar's Ramlila Ground.
Modi's address is being seen as the launch of BJP campaign for Delhi Assembly Election 2025. The elections to the 70-member Delhi assembly are expected to be held in February.
The Election Commission of India has not announced the dates yet. The term of the current assembly in Delhi expires on February 23, 2025.
Modi accused the AAP government in Delhi of indulging in scams in liquor, education and health. He also slammed the AAP government for not spending the Central government funds meant for education in the national capital.
The whole country knows this. Modi never built a home for himself. But in the last 10 years, I made sure that I built houses for four crore countrymen. I could have built a Sheesh Mahal for myself. But I chose to build houses for my people and fulfil their dreams, Modi said in an apparent attack on former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.
AAP, an AAPda: PM ModiModi was referring to the Civil Lines bungalow, where Kejriwal stayed while he was CM, and referred to as Sheesh Mahal by the BJP over the alleged corruption charges.
Earlier, Modi inaugurated a slew of developmental projects in the national capital on January 3, ahead of assembly polls. He inaugurated 1,675 newly constructed flats for the dwellers of JJ clusters and also handed over keys to beneficiaries at Swabhiman Apartments in Ashok Vihar, Delhi.
""The year 2025 will give a new direction to the good governance in the national capital... New politics of public welfare and nation welfare will begin this year and hence, 'AAPda ko hatana hai, aur BJP ko lana hai'..."" Modi said.
When is Delhi Assembly Election 2025?The Aam Aadmi Party, led by former chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, is seeking to retain power in Delhi for a third time. The party won assembly elections in 2015 and 2020. The AAP won 67 seats in 2015 and 63 in 2020 in the Delhi Assembly.
The AAP has released candidates for all 70 seats in Delhi. So far, the Congress has released the names of 47 candidates in its two lists. The BJP, which has not been in power in the national capital for 27 years, has not announced its candidates yet.
Modi also laid the foundation stone of Veer Savarkar College at Roshanpura, Najafgarh, which will have state-of-the-art facilities for education besides an academic block in East Delhi and an academic block in Dwarka.
Hindutva ideologue Veer Savarkar is a venerated figure for the Centre's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

There were no immediate reports of casualties.Arriving and departing flights have been reportedly halted at Ben Gurion International Airport, following the launch of missiles towards Tel Aviv.The rock attack came a day after Israel struck around 300 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon over 24 hours, ramping up its offensive to hit the group's finances, as the United States called for the war to end “as soon as possible”.  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due to begin a tour of the Middle East in Israel on Tuesday in a new push for an elusive ceasefire in the Gaza Strip after more than a year of war there and to contain the regional escalation.  In Lebanon, the health ministry said four people were killed and 24 wounded Monday evening in Israeli strikes near the country's largest public hospital, in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut.It earlier reported six people killed in the eastern city of Baalbek and said four rescuers linked to Hezbollah had died in the south in Israeli raids over 24 hours.

Another bunker, yet to be targeted, was estimated to hold ""at least half a billion dollars in dollar bills and gold"", he added.  Hagari also said the latest commander responsible for funding Iran-backed Hezbollah was ""eliminated"" Monday in Syria. The man was ""responsible for the transfers and the amount of funds"" to the group through Tehran's oil sales, he said.Syria's defence ministry earlier announced the death of two people in a strike attributed to Israel targeting a car in Damascus.  According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a memorial was being held nearby for Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, who was killed by Israel last week in Gaza, more than a year into the war triggered by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.","Air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv after Lebanon's Hezbollah launched missiles targeting the Nirit area.

Business Standard,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"If we want big change in sports, we must take big steps: Manu Bhaker","Back from Paris, where she shot her way to Olympic glory, Manu Bhaker heaps praise on coach Jaspal Rana. In a free-wheeling interview with Vishal Menon and Anushka Bhardwaj in New Delhi, Bhaker lays bare her insecurities, and explains why she created a fake social media profile to defend PV Sindhu from trolls. Edited excerpts:

You were the face of India’s Olympic campaign in Paris. With such media attention and so many brand deals, do you feel the weight of expectations?

Expectations have always been a part of my journey. They have been there since my victory in the 2018 Commonwealth Games. I am used to the pressure, but now it has reached another level. I am learning to deal with it. 

Can you relive your twin Olympic medals?
I was having my own issues with the 10-metre format. I was not in a very good shape in 2022 and 2023, but Jaspal (Rana) Sir said that I could do it. We were seated in the [shooting] hall and I was soaking everything in, preparing myself mentally. If it wasn’t for Jaspal sir, I wouldn’t be where I am today. My family and friends were also there to motivate me.
Both the medals were equally important, but for mixed doubles, we only qualified for the bronze, which we went on to win.
Before the Paris Games, your form kept fluctuating. How did you keep yourself motivated?

In the beginning of 2023, I thought of quitting. Nevertheless, I tried to push myself until at least the 2024 Olympics. I was trying to keep up with my routine, but I was not in a good space. There is a saying in the Bhagavad Gita that nothing is permanent. Both good and bad forms shall pass. I kept reminding myself of this. I am a firm believer of karma.

During this period, you planned to appear for the civil services exam.
Yes, I did. My subjects were political science and public administration. If I get 7-8 months, I can prepare. Right now, taking classes will be difficult.

How did you orchestrate this turnaround?
It was mostly mental. I had a very strict routine: wake up at 5: 30 am, do yoga, and head to the shooting range. After practice sessions, it is time for workouts, physio, and meditation before calling it a day. It was tiring, but I followed this routine for about three months.

Are you already thinking about the 2028 LA Olympics? 
As soon as the Tokyo Olympics ended, my eyes were on Paris. And now, the LA 2028 Olympics are on my mind. I will aim for gold.

Did you make a fake profile to launch a blistering attack on those trolling PV Sindhu?
Yes, I did. Usually, I am not on social media much. You cannot stop every ‘keyboard warrior’, but if I get the time and come across something hurtful, I might do it again. That’s my character.

Your thoughts on Prakash Padukone’s statement on athletes needing to be more accountable?
Prakash sir is a senior. He was one of the best athletes India ever had, and he continues to contribute to the sport in the best possible way. So, if he is saying something, he must have given it a thought. I am not a badminton player and personally I think athletes do try. Nobody wants to lose. I am sure Prakash sir had his reasons for saying so. After all, every sport – even shooting, though it is an individual sport – is a team effort. I need my strength and conditioning coach, physiotherapist, nutritionist, and definitely my coaches, and the support from the government. So, many factors are at play.

What is your assessment of India's performance at the Paris Olympics?
We won six medals, with eight others finishing in the fourth spot. I am sure India can do way better than this. We are going in the right direction, which is why athletes are performing better at the Games. But we must not forget that every country is preparing for the best. If we want to see a big change, we must take some big steps. 
Such as?
Starting grassroot-level programmes is the key. We need to identify the athletes at a young age. In countries like the US and China, everything is government funded, and they look at it from a long-term perspective, say, about 20 years. But here we look at immediacy, at the next Olympic cycle. This mindset needs to change.
Is India ready to host the Olympics?
We can see the progress, but we can’t say what the next five or 10 years will bring. The real question is: how well can the Games be organised? Honestly, it's up to the government and corporate entities. That said, hosting the Olympics will definitely encourage a sporting culture.
As a shooter, how much emphasis do you put on physical fitness?
If you want longevity, you need physical strength. In shooting, there are cases of overuse injury because a lot of pressure is put on the same muscles. There could be injuries in the neck, back, shoulder, elbow, and knee. To overcome it, you need physical strength.

Your thoughts on Vinesh Phogat’s disqualification? 
I am not aware of the technicalities of what transpired, and what should or shouldn’t have happened. All I can say is that I have known her since 2017 or 2018, and I believe that she is a fighter. I am sure she will be able to survive this phase, and probably contribute more to Indian wrestling.

And what do you think about Turkish shooter Yusuf Dikec, who went viral on social media?
All the shooters have to put their free hand in their pocket or in a belt. Like Yusuf, I also put my hand in my pocket. As far as using the gear is concerned, it depends from person to person. It's a personal choice, and a matter of getting used to the equipment. Even 10 years ago, I didn’t see as many people using equipment as they do today. When I started, eight years ago, there were so many options.","Olympic shooter Manu Bhaker reflects on her journey, praising coach Jaspal Rana for his support during her challenging times, especially before winning twin Olympic medals in Paris. Despite contemplating quitting in early 2023, Bhaker persevered with a strict routine, drawing inspiration from the Bhagavad Gita and her belief in karma.

Comparably, Mohit Gulati, CIO and managing partner of ITI Growth Opportunities Fund, said it is another real estate firm joining the market at its peak. It is similar to 2007.

Gulati believes that the real estate market will slow down since MMR demand has bottomed down. According to Mohit, it will be difficult for Arkade to surpass projections in the upcoming year given this pattern.

GEPL Capital Private Ltd Arkade Developers Limited, according to the brokerage, specialises in upscale residential projects in desirable areas of Mumbai, including both brand-new construction and the renovation of existing structures. The business is well known for finishing projects ahead of time. The reduction in its borrowings from ₹149 crores in FY23 to ₹69 crores in FY24 is advantageous for the firm.

Arkade has shown strong financial success, with sales growing at a 39% CAGR and PAT growing at a 34% CAGR. The company's increasing net worth highlights both its sound financial standing and exciting expansion prospects. Though presently limited to Mumbai, growth into more locations may improve margins even further.

Participating in the motion of thanks, Bordumsa-Diyun MLA Nikh Kamin drew the government’s attention to the deplorable condition of the educational infrastructure in his constituency.

“When you go to the government schools, infrastructures are in a sorry state. For example, in Bordumsa area, the schools do not have basic facilities and do not have ceilings,” Kamin said.

He argued that the current state of the schools in his constituency is such that “they are not fit to be called educational institutions,” and appealed to the chief minister and the education minister to intervene and transform the education scenario there.

“I hope that under the chief minister and the education minister the state’s education scenario will change,” he said.

Kamin also drew the government’s attention to the health sector, and urged the health minister to “create a robust health delivery system, including availability of free medicines for the common people.”

“There is shortage of doctors; the government should pay attention to the work culture and streamline the health sector,” he said.

Borduria MLA Wanglin Lowangdong in his speech underlined the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER)-2024, vis-à-vis the education scenario of the state.

Emphasising that the education sector needs extra attention, he pointed out that the ASER report “highlights the significant deficiency in basic reading in the government schools.”

Lowangdong said that “34 per cent of our youths in Papum Pare district could not read Class 2-level English text, and only 39.9 per cent could solve simple arithmetic problems.”

“Due to low enrollment, 400 schools have been closed. Shortage of teachers is there for all of us to see. Four hundred more assistant professors are needed in the government colleges,” he added, and urged the government to pay attention to the issues.

The Pioneer,2025-01-03 00:00:00,"No scrapping of Adani Solar energy deal, without proof: Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu","Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said the state government cannot scrap power purchase agreements with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) without obtaining solid proof of bribery allegations. The Chief Minister’s comments assume significance in the backdrop of Adani being indicted by the US Department of Justice over his role in an alleged years-long scheme to pay USD 250 million bribes to Indian officials in exchange for favourable solar power contracts, including from Andhra Pradesh. This allegation was refuted by the Indian conglomerate.

The previous YSRCP regime in Andhra Pradesh is embroiled in this alleged scam with claims that government officials received bribes from the Adani Group, which reportedly amounted to Rs 1,750 crore.

“We are getting proper documentation and once we get that then we will take action (if there was any corruption involved). If we cancel the MoUs right away then it may lead to legal issues and unnecessary complications,” Naidu told reporters, during an informal interaction with reporters on Wednesday at TDP headquarters in Mangalagiri.

The CM’s comments came after Andhra Pradesh Power Distribution Companies’ decision earlier last month to procure over 4,000 million units of power from SECI, out of the total agreed 17,000 MU from the next fiscal.

The Chief Minister stressed that he can proceed with action on anybody only after thoroughly establishing the documentary proofs in reaction to questions from reporters as to why he is not acting against certain individuals.

“I never indulge in political vendettas. However, I will not spare wrongdoers. Regardless of how great they are, the culprits should be brought to justice” he said.

The CM noted that he would take action only after procuring the required documentary evidence. Moreover, Naidu asserted that SECI’s agreement to buy power from the Adani Group was an ‘advantage’ to Andhra Pradesh and action against bribery allegations will be only after thoroughly establishing the evidence.

Refuting the bribery allegations, the YSR Congress Party has said the agreement was between the state government, Discoms and SECI which is a central government organisation and there is no third-party involvement.

Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president YS Sharmila recently alleged that the previous YSRCP regime had forged a 25-year deal with the Adani conglomerate to buy power at Rs 2.49 per unit while the Gujarat-based corporate house was supplying it only at Rs 1.99 per unit in Gujarat, burdening Andhra Pradesh people b","Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has stated that the state government cannot cancel power purchase agreements with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) without concrete proof of bribery. His remarks come amid allegations that the Adani Group was involved in a scheme to pay bribes worth USD 250 million to Indian officials for favorable solar power contracts, including those in Andhra Pradesh. The allegations, which were refuted by Adani, claim that bribes amounting to Rs 1,750 crore were paid to government officials during the YSR Congress Party's (YSRCP) tenure.

Naidu emphasized the importance of solid documentation before taking any action, warning that cancelling the agreements without proper evidence could lead to legal complications. He noted that while the state government would not engage in political vendettas, it would not hesitate to take action against wrongdoers once the evidence is clear. He also defended the SECI-Adani power agreements, stating that they were beneficial to the state, and that any action regarding bribery allegations would only be taken after verifying the facts thoroughly.

The YSRCP has denied the bribery claims, asserting that the deal was between the state, Discoms, and SECI, without any third-party involvement. The Andhra Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) has accused the previous regime of striking a 25-year deal with Adani at inflated rates, resulting in higher electricity costs for the people of Andhra Pradesh.",National News,228,400
The Hindu,2024-07-16 00:00:00,Trade deficit widens 9.4% from a year ago as imports outspace exports,"India’s goods exports rose for the third successive month this June, growing 2.55% to $35.2 billion. Imports grew 5% to $56.2 billion, receding from May’s seven-month peak of nearly $62 billion. The trade deficit, despite rising 9.4% from last June, has cooled slightly from the previous month. The oil deficit, which had hit a record $13 billion in May, remains a worry despite narrowing to $10 billion. Petroleum exports fell 18.3% to $5.5 billion, and were below May’s tally by almost the same extent. With oil prices virtually unchanged over the last two months, this signals a drop in export volumes, just as a sharper 19.6% rise in June’s oil imports suggests a domestic demand spike. Overall oil imports have risen over 23% in the April to June quarter, with global prices about 9% higher than a year ago. The oil deficit accounts for almost half of the first quarter trade deficit of $62 billion in the first quarter, which is 10.9% over that of last year.

The value of gold imports fell 38.7% in June to $3.06 billion, the lowest so far in 2024-25. But silver imports, which have been rising sharply, jumped 377% in June. The government must investigate concerns about disruptions in India’s bullion market due to concessional duty imports through the GIFT City under the free trade pact with the United Arab Emirates. Alongside, a sustained decline in India’s gems and jewellery exports, which contracted for the seventh successive month in June, needs attention. The import bill, beyond oil and gold, has risen about 3% so far this year, from a 10% dip in the same quarter last year, with growth accelerating to 7% in June, indicating a recovery in discretionary domestic demand — a good omen for the economy. India’s trade policy focus must stay on boosting exports rather than checking the deficit which has been termed a natural corollary of growing faster than the world. It is notable that at least 19 of India’s top 30 export sectors have grown over May and June, from just 13 in April. Waning global inflation, and likely interest rate cuts can fuel demand, and the International Monetary Fund has raised its trade volume growth hopes to 3% in 2024 from 0.3% last year. For exporters to fully tap this opportunity after a rough year, and create more jobs in the process, the Centre must provide adequate resources as well as certainty for the sector, be it for the duty remission scheme or the interest equalisation scheme. Sudden policy shifts such as the recent scrapping of the latter scheme for all exporters, except for smaller firms (which have been promised support for only two more months), are certainly avoidable.

Dream Bazaar in Karachi was aggressively advertised as Pakistan’s biggest thrift store, promising unbelievable discounts on designer clothing, homeware and accessories. Perhaps keen to grab a good bargain, thousands of Karachi residents flocked to the shopping mall on the day of its inauguration.
However, lack of crowd control and police action led to the mall being ransacked by unruly shoppers. Local reports suggest that clothes were stolen, people were pushed and shoved around and parts of the property damaged by the mob. Dream Bazaar management struggled to control the swelling crowd. When some employees closed the front door to more shoppers, baton-wielding individuals broke the glass and rushed inside.

According to ARY News, police did not intervene to control the crowd, but some eyewitnesses said that cops were seen hitting innocent bystanders at the scene.
In one video shared online, an eyewitness to the chaos was heard criticising the unruly mob. “Ye kaun log hain. Ye kahan se aate hain… barbaad kar diya (Who are these people? Where have they come from? They have destroyed the store),” the person filming the video was heard saying.

Villagers alleged that the minor, who was missing since Friday evening, was raped and murdered, and the police did not act on their complaint immediately.

As the body of the girl was recovered by locals in Jaynagar area early this morning, a mob torched the Mahismari police outpost and pelted the policemen with stones.

They also vandalised several vehicles parked outside the outpost and the policemen were forced to leave the premises, a senior officer said.

A huge police force was sent to the area and tear gas shells were fired to quell the mob which tried to confine the SDPO and other senior personnel at the spot.

""The family members of the girl lodged an FIR at the Mahismari outpost in the area but the police did not act on the complaint immediately,"" a local claimed.

The police responded in the same manner as they did after the body of a woman doctor was found at R G Kar hospital in August, another villager said.

""We will continue our agitation till all those accused in the rape and murder of our minor daughter are punished. We also demand action against those who responded to the complaint late, which might have resulted in her death. Had the police acted promptly, the girl could have been rescued,"" Ganesh Dolui, a local, said.
The police, however, said the action was taken immediately after the complaint was received and an accused was arrested in connection with the alleged rape and murder of the girl.

""After lodging of FIR at 9 pm on Friday, police swung into action and arrested an accused this morning after an initial probe. Investigation is on and we are with the family of the deceased.""

""Those involved in arson at the police outpost and destroying of all important documents will be identified and action will be taken against them,"" the official added.

Kultali TMC MLA Ganesh Mondal was chased away by the villagers when he went to the spot to pacify the locals who accused him of trying to support the ""police inaction"".

Mondal later told reporters that he understood the grievances and anger of the people of the area but they should not take the law in their hands.

""Our party and I are with the aggrieved villagers and the parents of the child. I have requested the police to investigate the matter thoroughly, frame charges against the accused and do whatever is required to instil confidence among the people,"" he said.

Expressing shock over the incident, Union Minister and West Bengal BJP president Sukanta Majumdar said, ""A Class 4 girl was forcibly lifted, raped and murdered while returning from tuition. The women of Bengal are not safe. They are being killed even during Devi Paksha (the 15 period heralding the advent of goddess Durga since Mahalaya).

The Navhind Times,2024-08-20 00:00:00,"Blinken says Israel agrees to ceasefire, calls on Hamas to do same","Tel Aviv

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday that Israel has accepted a proposal to bridge differences holding up a cease-fire and hostage release in Gaza, and he called on Hamas to do the same, without saying whether it had addressed concerns cited by the militant group.

Blinken spoke after holding a two and a half hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and was expected to travel to Egypt on Tuesday. The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent months trying to broker an agreement, with the talks repeatedly stalling.

He did not say whether the so-called bridging proposal addressed Israel's demands for control over two strategic corridors inside Gaza, which Hamas has said is a nonstarter, or other issues that have long bedevilled the negotiations.

""In a very constructive meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu today, he confirmed to me that Israel supports the bridging proposal,"" Blinken told reporters. ""The next important step is for Hamas to say yes.'""

Blinken had earlier said the time is now to conclude a Gaza cease-fire agreement that would return hostages held by Hamas and bring relief to Palestinian suffering after more than 10 months of devastating fighting in Gaza.

Blinken's ninth mission to the Middle East since the conflict began came days after mediators expressed renewed optimism that a deal was near. But Hamas has expressed deep dissatisfaction with the latest proposal, and Israel has said there were points on which it was unwilling to compromise. The trip, days before new talks expected this week in Egypt, came amid fears that the conflict could widen into a deeper regional war following the targeted killing of two top militants in Lebanon and Iran that were attributed to Israel.

""This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last, opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a cease-fire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security,"" Blinken said.","US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that Israel has accepted a proposal to address obstacles blocking a cease-fire and hostage release in Gaza.

The Hindu ,2024-08-19 00:00:00,Former CSIR chief Girish Sahni passes away,"Former director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Girish Sahni, passed away August 19 at the age of 68. Multiple sources told The Hindu he had died of a heart attack.On X (formerly Twitter), CSIR said it “mourns the sudden loss” in a 5:40 pm post.Dr. Sahni joined the Institute of Microbial Technology (IMTECH), a CSIR laboratory in Chandigarh, in 1991. He became its director in 2005, a position he held until he was appointed the CSIR director-general in 2015. He continued to be associated with IMTECH, sources said.As a scientist, Dr. Sahni was known for his research on the formation and alleviation of blood clots and ‘clot buster’ drugs. Among others, he developed clot-specific streptokinase, a drug whose licensing rights were sold to Nostrum Pharmaceuticals in New Jersey, the U.S., in 2006 for $5 million.He also led teams that developed the country’s first indigenous clot-bluster drug later, marketed under the name ‘STPase’ by Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd., and another drug, recombinant streptokinase, subsequently marketed under the names ‘Klotbuster’ and ‘LupiFlo’.His time at the helm of the CSIR was often tumultuous. In 2016, for example, a product called BGR-34 developed by two CSIR labs in Lucknow came under scrutiny after Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised its allegedly anti-diabetic effects in a speech. It was being sold at the time by a private entity and bore the CSIR logo. Multiple eminent scientists had questioned CSIR’s “moral, ethical, and public health responsibility” over the product’s lack of scientific testing.But Dr. Sahni’s time as CSIR director-general was more marked by financial issues. In June 2015, the year he assumed charge, the Union government -- itself 18 months into the new Bharatiya Janata Party rule -- asked CSIR to start paying for half of its expenses in two to three years in a bid to cut spending. Government officials said the move was aimed at guiding CSIR to better serve “national interests”. It also had Dr. Sahni’s full support, who at the time said, “It’s high time Indian scientists rose to the occasion, and not merely published papers to satisfy their natural curiosity.”Independent scientists flayed the rapid shift to self-financing citing the lack of a funding structure that channelled money from industry for scientific research.Only two years later, CSIR declared a financial emergency. In 2017, Dr. Sahni had sent a letter to CSIR staffers saying that out of its allocation of ₹4,063 crore in the 2017-2018 Union Budget, “the balance available for laboratory allocations and various new research projects” after capital costs and salaries and pensions was only ₹202 crore -- a fraction of the ₹1,200 crore the organisation had said it needed to fund new research projects.“The crunch was primarily due to the organisation having to meet the increased salary outgo from recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission and a ₹1,650 crore-hit towards meeting pension requirements,” The Hindu had reported.In the same letter Dr. Sahni had asked for CSIR labs to compile the contents of their “current technology basket (old and new ones) as well as at least one outstanding game-changer technology” that could be licensed to industry, and charged the CSIR Business Development Group with drafting “a strategy paper on the roadmap to market CSIR’s knowledge base” by June 2017. New CSIR projects were also required to include stakeholders to bear the “cost of all temporary manpower, consumables and contingencies” and bear nearly a third of the capital cost.The money problem disappeared in 2018, however, even though the allocation to CSIR had increased only by 3.3%. Dr. Sahni had expected CSIR labs to raise ₹1,000 crore in revenue per year by 2017, but data released in March 2018 showed the average revenue between 2014 and 2018 was around ₹475 crore per year.His term as CSIR director-general concluded in August 2018.Dr. Sahni was a member of India’s three major science academies. He was also a recipient of the National Biotechnology Product Development Award (2002), the CSIR Technology Shield (2001-2002), and the Vigyan Rattan Award (2014), among others.","Dr. Girish Sahni, the former Director General of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), has passed away. A distinguished scientist and leader, Dr. Sahni was widely recognized for his contributions to the field of biotechnology and scientific research in India. During his tenure as CSIR chief from 2015 to 2018, he was instrumental in driving several key initiatives that advanced India's scientific capabilities and innovation landscape.Dr. Sahni's work in the development of lifesaving biopharmaceuticals, particularly his role in the creation of clot-busting drugs, earned him national and international acclaim. Under his leadership, CSIR made significant strides in various scientific domains, including health, energy, and environmental research, reinforcing its position as a leading research organization globally.His passing marks a significant loss to the Indian scientific community, where he was not only respected for his research contributions but also for his visionary leadership and dedication to fostering innovation.

“Modric arrived at Real Madrid in 2012, and in his 12 seasons representing our shirt he has become a Real Madrid and world football legend,” Madrid said.The 38-year-old Ballon d’Or winner in 2018 won a sixth Champions League crown as well as a fourth La Liga title with Real last season.

Modric’s previous contract expired at the end of the 2023-24 season but the Croatian told fans he would return next season when they were celebrating their Champions League triumph which extended Real’s record to 15 European Cups.No player has won more titles with Real Madrid than Modric, who has lifted 26 trophies since he joined the Spanish giants in 2012.

The veteran player was widely expected to retire, especially after his long-time midfield partner Toni Kroos, 34, announced his retirement at the end of the season.

Modric also had no plans to hang up his boots on the international stage despite Croatia’s early exit from the recently-concluded European Championship, where they were eliminated after the group stage.

“I’d like to keep playing forever but there probably will come a time when I must hang up my boots.

“I’ll keep playing on, but I don’t know for how much longer,” said Modric, who has 178 caps for Croatia.

Modric has made 178 appearances with Croatia and is the nation’s all-time record-holder for international caps. He has made 534 appearances for Madrid, having scored 39 goals.","Croatian midfielder Luka Modric has extended his contract with Real Madrid for another year, committing to the club until 2025.

Despite speculation about retirement, Modric remains committed to playing, both for Real Madrid and Croatia, where he holds the record for most international appearances with 178 caps.",Sports,92,264
Hindustan Times,2025-01-01 00:00:00,‘Not the time to put out… ’: Ex-cricketers' razor-sharp reactions to Gautam Gambhir's dressing room leaks after MCG loss,"Former India cricketers WV Raman and Irfan Pathan are not impressed with the dressing room leaks in the media in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. The MCG defeat has put India in a spot of bother in the World Test Championship Final race as now, even if they win the Sydney Test, they still have to rely on the result of the Sri Lanka vs Australia Test series to stay alive. Meanwhile, Australia have a bright chance to win the Border-Gavaskar Trophy after a decade as they look in complete control of the series with a 2-1 lead at the moment.
The Indian batters failed to soak the pressure while chasing the 34-run target on Day 5 of the Melbourne Test. The visitors had the whole day but couldn't make it count, fiery spells from the Aussie bowling attack bundled out India at 155 in the 80th over. Team India head coach Gautam Gambhir was reportedly unhappy with how some of the batters got out. There have been far too many collapses in the last year, leading to multiple defeats. Gambhir is now under immense pressure after New Zealand's embarrassing whitewash at home and is on the verge of losing BGT.

According to an Indian Express report, Gambhir said, ""Enough is enough"" in the dressing room.

""Shortly after India lost seven wickets in 20.4 overs and handed the Melbourne Test to Australia, head coach Gautam Gambhir had some stern words for the entire squad in the dressing room on Monday. “Bahut ho gaya (I’ve had enough),” the report stated.

Raman, a former head coach of the Indian women’s team, stated that India is still alive in the series and can draw it, but the dressing room leaks will make things worse. “#Teamindia has the chance to draw the #BGT. So, they need to be allowed to get on with their jobs. This is not the time to put out selective leaks and stoke the fire.

livemint,2024-09-17 00:00:00,"Oasis, Ticketmaster and the price of economic ignorance","Economic ignorance, like rock ’n’ roll, never dies. It just fades away. Eventually it comes roaring back louder and dumber than ever.

In the U.S., ignorance of economics shows up in debates over price gouging and trade protectionism. These topics are boring and easy for politicians to lie about, especially to voters unfamiliar with the elegant simplicity of supply and demand. On the other side of the Atlantic, economic ignorance comes in sexier packaging. It has a backbeat.

Oasis is an English rock band whose core members are the quarrelsome siblings Liam and Noel Gallagher. Even those unfamiliar with Britpop-era hits such as “Wonderwall"" and “Champagne Supernova"" might have heard about the brothers’ squabbling. Oasis has historically had trouble staying together. Their most recent split lasted 15 years, during which time fans prayed constantly for a reunion. Speculation about the potential end of the great Gallagher estrangement was a British media staple.

Last month the boys buried the hatchet and announced a series of 2025 concerts. Delirious fans who were young and relatively poor during the band’s heyday are now older and relatively rich. They have the willingness and ability to pay to see Oasis in concert. Economically speaking, that’s called demand.

But demand is only one side of the economic story, morning glory. For the moment at least, the Oasis reunion is limited to a handful of shows. Wembley Stadium is large but not infinitely so, and there’s no guarantee the brothers will remain on speaking terms beyond next summer. Fans understand that this may be their last chance to see the Gallagher lads together onstage. Supply is limited.

Introductory economics tells us that when supply is tight and demand is high, prices rise to an equilibrium, which is exactly what happened. Oasis reunion tickets were initially priced at £150, or about $200. This proved far too low. When the online sale went live, Ticketmaster’s “dynamic pricing"" system instantly adjusted prices upward. Some ticket buyers reported paying more than £400.

Some accused the greedy brothers of ripping off their loyal fans. Many more aimed their fury at Ticketmaster, the American ticket-sales behemoth owned by Live Nation Entertainment. The furor revealed a terrible ignorance, even among the highly educated, of what prices are and how they work.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the House of Commons that he found it “depressing"" to hear of the Oasis “price hikes."" He promised a commission to investigate what he called “extortionate price resales."" Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told the BBC that “vastly inflated prices"" would exclude “ordinary fans.""

Bollocks. In economic terms, a concert ticket is no different from a book, a bottle of wine or a house. It has no inherent value, only the price a buyer is willing to pay and a seller is willing to accept. The market-clearing price of anything is where demand meets supply. The correct and fair price is whatever the market will bear. No buyer has a right to a low price, just as no seller has a right to a high price.

Oasis could be nice guys and sell their tickets for $5, but scalpers would snatch them all up and resell them for more. Significantly more, as it turns out. What good would it do Oasis, or the ordinary fan, to allow third-party resellers to capture all that value?

A high price doesn’t indicate greed any more than a low price indicates generosity. Absent force or fraud, price reflects the point at which buyer and seller both agree that the transaction makes each of them better off. The beauty of it is that economic exchange in a free market is entirely voluntary. Oasis doesn’t have to play, and you don’t have to pay. Who’s getting ripped off?

After a decade of public experience with ride-sharing apps like Uber, you’d think consumers would have honed their understanding of how the price mechanism works. Sadly, Oasisgate suggests this isn’t the case.

But what about Ticketmaster? Surely it adds nothing so valuable to the transaction as to justify the rise in price. In fact, this is where the story gets interesting. Ticketmaster makes for a convenient villain. But, as music industry guru Bob Lefsetz explains, that’s its job. “The acts hide behind Ticketmaster,"" he writes in a recent newsletter. Bands like Oasis want to cash in on their popularity, but they don’t want to be seen charging $1,000 a seat for their concerts. That isn’t the image Gallagher brothers have spent their 30-year career cultivating.

Ticketmaster, on the other hand, writes Mr. Lefsetz, “makes no music, it’s inert, and therefore it can accept all the blame."" The dirty little secret: “Ticketmaster does nothing that the band does not agree to."" The key thing to remember is that nobody got hurt here. Everyone is going home happy: the band, Ticketmaster and especially Oasis fans who finally get the chance to see the reunion they never thought possible.

Don’t let anyone tell you that free markets are a ripoff. Mutual satisfaction is their great selling point. If you’re one of the lucky ones who managed to snag a ticket, stop crying your heart out. Roll with it. Liam and Noel aren’t going to live forever.

Mr. Hennessey is the Journal’s deputy editorial features editor and author of “Visible Hand: A Wealth of Notions on the Miracle of the Market."""," Oasis tickets were initially priced at £150, or about $200. Some fans reported paying more than £400 for tickets to see the band's reunion shows. The correct and fair price is whatever the market will bear, says Simon Tisdall.

Indian Express,2024-10-30 00:00:00,"Panel after NEET UG paper leak: Send test paper digitally, answers on OMR sheet","The committee was tasked with suggesting reforms to strengthen data security protocols, improve the examination process, and review the structure and operations of the NTA. It submitted its report to the Education Ministry recently.Holding entrance exams online wherever possible and using a hybrid model, where question papers are transmitted digitally but answered on paper, if needed; conducting a multi-stage exam for medical aspirants; rationalising the choice of subjects under the Central University Entrance Test (CUET); and staffing the National Testing Agency (NTA) with more permanent personnel to manage these changes effectively.

These are among the key recommendations made by the seven-member committee, headed by former ISRO head Dr K Radhakrishnan, set up after the recent National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) paper leak  that set off nationwide furore.

The committee was tasked with suggesting reforms to strengthen data security protocols, improve the examination process, and review the structure and operations of the NTA. It submitted its report to the Education Ministry recently.The Indian Express has learned that the committee has not limited its recommendations to reforms for NEET but has proposed long-term measures to secure all entrance tests conducted by the Centre.

Broadly, it is understood that the panel has advocated for greater government control over exam administration. This would include increasing the number of its own examination centres instead of outsourcing the conduct of exams to service providers and employing more permanent staff for the NTA which relies heavily on contractual personnel.Currently, examinations conducted by the NTA are typically held in government-run schools and colleges. When these venues are insufficient, the agency enlists AICTE-recognised institutes and colleges.If that still falls short, service providers — agencies that assist with the online conduct of the exams — also bring in other private centres. It is learned that the use of these private centres has been discouraged by the panel.Further, while the panel has advocated for conducting entrance tests online as much as possible, it has suggested a hybrid mode for cases where this is not feasible.In the hybrid mode, the question paper will be transmitted digitally to the exam centre but candidates will mark their answers on an OMR sheet. “This will significantly reduce the number of hands that the question paper passes through,” said a source.

This suggestion is significant given that the NEET-UG paper leak allegedly occurred when the question paper, after reaching an exam centre in Hazaribagh, Jharkhand, was accessed illegally and allegedly handed over to individuals who solved it.

Transmitting the paper digitally enables the exam-conducting agency to release the questions much closer to the examination start time, enhancing security and eliminating the need for the paper to go first to a printing press, then be stored in a bank strong room, and finally be handed over to the exam centre.

On CUET, the committee has suggested limiting the choice of subjects for candidates. At present, the NTA, which conducts CUET on behalf of the University Grants Commission, offers over 50 subjects, allowing candidates to take tests in up to six of them.The Radhakrishnan panel is said to have argued against the logic behind so many tests. “Why should a science student, who has already appeared for Board exams, have to sit for another test in the same subjects? The role of subjects should primarily be to determine eligibility, while CUET should assess general aptitude and some subject knowledge to prepare a merit list for college admissions. Why should students take up to six papers if they have already completed their board exams?” said a source.Moreover, having so many subjects means creating multiple sets of question papers, which, in turn, increases the number of people involved — a factor “we should ideally minimise to maintain security and confidentiality,” the source added.

The Radhakrishnan panel is also reported to have recommended that NEET-UG be conducted in multiple stages, preferably two, similar to the Joint Entrance Exam, which includes JEE Main and JEE Advanced, due to the large number of aspirants. Nearly 20 lakh medical aspirants have registered for NEET-UG this year. Additionally, the panel suggested capping the number of attempts for NEET-UG, as currently, candidates can take the exam as many times as they wish.With Radhakrishnan, the expert committee includes former AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria; Hyderabad Central University Vice-Chancellor B J Rao; Professor Emeritus in the Department of Civil Engineering at IIT Madras, Ramamurthy K; Karmayogi Bharat Board Member, Pankaj Bansal; IIT Delhi Professor Aditya Mittal; and Joint Secretary in the Education Ministry Govind Jaiswal.

","A seven-member committee, led by former ISRO chief Dr. K Radhakrishnan, proposed reforms to enhance data security, improve the examination process, and review the operations of the National Testing Agency (NTA) following a NEET paper leak incident. Key recommendations include conducting entrance exams online where feasible and adopting a hybrid model that uses digital question paper transmission while allowing paper-based answer sheets. The committee advocates for greater government oversight by increasing the number of exam centers and staffing the NTA with permanent personnel instead of relying on contractors, discouraging the use of private centers.

For the Central University Entrance Test (CUET), the panel suggests limiting subject choices to streamline examinations and reduce staffing complexities. Additionally, it proposes a multi-stage NEET-UG exam, similar to the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE), to accommodate the large number of aspirants, and recommends capping the number of attempts for candidates. The committee emphasizes heightened security measures to prevent future incidents, making significant long-term recommendations that extend beyond NEET to all centrally conducted entrance tests.",Education,168,747

Financial Express,2024-08-19 00:00:00,Caught in a cleft,"Companies are either not able to push volumes due to low demand, or aren’t raising prices to retain market share

India Inc’s performance in the June 2024 quarter has been disappointing to say the least. Among the larger companies, misses far outnumbered the positive surprises. While the subdued numbers have been attributed partly to a harsh summer and the general elections, it is evident that consumption demand remains weak and that the rural recovery hasn’t been as strong as was anticipated. 

This is reflected in the muted growth (just 5-8% year-on-year) in revenues over the past several quarters. Companies have either not been able to push volumes because demand has been tepid or they have been unable to raise prices for fear of losing market share. This has been particularly true for the consumer goods space where even leading players have been unable to grow volumes meaningfully.
With the raw materials bill falling only slightly during the quarter — only 43 basis points (bps) compared with a much steeper drop in earlier quarters — operating profit margins (OPM) have been under pressure across businesses. At JSW Steel, for instance, the OPM contracted by a steep 350 bps driving down the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) by 22%. Again, at Asian Paints the margins contracted by as much as 422 bps y-o-y driving down the EBITDA by more than 20%. 
Companies have been trying to rein in costs — the wage bill in Q1FY25, for example, went up by a relatively slower rate than in Q3 and Q2FY24.

In fact, the interest bill too hasn’t risen much. Despite this, the aggregate net profits for a sample of 2,347 companies (excluding oil marketing companies, banks, and financials) grew at 15% y-o-y, the slowest in at least four quarters. 

As analysts at Motilal Oswal have said, the 4% y-o-y growth in net profits for the Nifty50 firms is the slowest since the June 2020 quarter when the pandemic had set in. To be sure India’s macroeconomic story remains strong and the gradual pick-up in private sector investment is expected to boost employment. 

However, consumption demand has been weak for nearly two years now for several reasons including high joblessness and inflation. Demand for cars, which has been buoyant, is slowing and this could happen for homes too. Moreover, the slowdown in exports remains a big concern since it is a sector that employs large numbers. 

Importantly, newer players and technologies are disrupting the business models of legacy players and have driven up competition across sectors. As such revenues are now distributed across a larger number of players in consumer-oriented sectors.

The good news is that software services firms have a more positive outlook on discretionary spends by clients and a few have upped their guidance. Analysts are not sure if there is a significant broad-based pick-up in spends because clients continue to focus on cost-saving initiatives, but they expect spends to start normalising early next year. 

While banks have fared reasonably well, and asset quality has shown few worrisome signs, banks have been hiking loan rates to protect their margins as the cost of borrowings goes up. The concern is that at such high interest rates, demand for credit might be impacted. With numbers not living up to expectations, earnings have been downgraded for a large number of companies. While the festive season should boost demand, it’s not clear how India Inc. will fare in the rest of the year.","India Inc's performance in Q2 2024 has been disappointing, with many large companies reporting weaker-than-expected results. Revenue growth has stagnated at just 5-8% year-on-year, driven by low consumer demand and an inability to raise prices without losing market share. Operating profit margins are under pressure, with significant declines noted at JSW Steel and Asian Paints. While net profits for a sample of companies grew by 15% year-on-year—the slowest in four quarters—persistent weak demand, especially in consumer goods, remains a concern. Although banks have performed reasonably well, high interest rates could dampen credit demand, impacting overall economic growth.",Business and Finance,97,580

As I have stated earlier Pandian has served the state and party with utmost dedication, efficiency and integrity and is known and respected for the same,” he said in a post on X.

The saffron party also rejected a claim made in the report that Patnaik had assured Shah of BJD’s support in the Rajya Sabha where the NDA lacks a majority.

BJP vice president Biranchi Narayan Tripathy said, “BJP doesn’t need any help from the BJD as it has the majority in the state and at the Centre.”

After the BJD’s debacle in the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections, Patnaik had said that Pandian is a person of integrity and honesty and should be remembered for that.

The Pioneer,2024-09-09 00:00:00,Traffic woes to end soon,"In a move to decongest, and ensure maximum utilisation of its capacity, private as well as Government interstate buses will have to pay the same amount of parking fee for using the bus bays at inter-state bus terminals in the national capital. Buses will be provided with a parking time slot of 25 minutes at a fixed rate of Rs 500 (excluding Good and Services tax). After that, charges will be applied for every five-minute extra. It was also decided that only buses with Fastag be allowed to enter the terminals to ensure tracking. The new norms and rates will be soon notified at interstate terminals. Delhi has three operational inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) at Kashmere Gate, Anand Vihar and Sarai Kale Khan having their optimum capacity of 3,000 per day against 1,700 now.

According to a Raj Niwas official, lower turnaround times will not only reduce the waiting period for passengers but also ensure that buses circulate at a faster pace, speed up traffic-pedestrian and vehicle movement outside ISBTs, and generate more revenue for the transport department.

“As of now private buses are charged more, which leads to a situation where they unauthorisedly park and pick passengers on roads outside the ISBT complex, resulting in huge traffic snarls apart from causing passenger/revenue loss to State run buses.

Lt Governor Vinai KumarSaxena inspected the Maharana Pratap ISBT at Kashmere Gate on August 31 and subsequently held a high-level meeting that was attended by Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot,” a Raj Niwas official said.The transport department is set to notify the new rates and norms for to-and-fro interstate buses utilising the iconic terminals.

“Emphasising that efficiency and equality are two most important factors to achieve optimum utilisation of facilities, LG suggested equal parking rates for Government as well as private buses and also reducing parking time equally to achieve higher turnaround. He also asked for only buses with Fastag stickers to be allowed to enter ISBT, so as to ensure complete tracking without human interface,” he said. Once notified, the new norms will not only ensure efficiency in the functioning and operation of ISBTs but also enable the facilities to function to their optimum capacity of 3,000 per day against 1,700 now, he added.

The under-utilisation is because of rate differences between Government and private buses, poor management of parking bays, staff using terminals as resting places, and systemic issues such as staggered circulation due to extended turnaround times leading to traffic snarls outside, the official said.

A system of differential parking or utilisation charges based on time is also set to be notified to reduce turnaround time. Buses will be provided with a parking time slot of 25 minutes at a fixed rate. After that, charges will be applied for every five-minute extra. Enforcement and implementation will be ensured through Fastags, he said.

Buses without Fastags will not be permitted inside the terminals. A facility will be provided outside the ISBT complex where a bus without Fastag can buy one before entering, he added","To enhance efficiency and reduce congestion at inter-state bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi, a new policy has been introduced requiring both private and government interstate buses to pay the same parking fee of ₹500 (excluding GST) for a 25-minute time slot.

Only buses equipped with Fastag will be allowed to enter the terminals, ensuring proper tracking and management.

Currently, Delhi operates three ISBTs—Kashmere Gate, Anand Vihar, and Sarai Kale Khan—capable of handling 3,000 buses daily, but only serving around 1,700 due to inefficiencies. This new measure aims to streamline bus circulation, minimize waiting times for passengers, and generate more revenue for the transport department.

the telegraph,2024-07-19 00:00:00,"Bad Newz: Vicky Kaushal shines alone, and in vain, in this otherwise not-so-good film","Bad Newz is a great title for a film about a woman who gets pregnant with twins from two different fellas (yes, heteropaternal superfecundation is real, and most of you already know that, thanks to Google suggestions when you type hetero). But it is not because of its central plot, which is perhaps the only thing original about this movie. It is because almost everything else is, well, not so good.

We say almost because Vicky Kaushal is incandescent as West Delhi munda Akhil Chaddha. Ranvir Singh might have patented the act with Band Baaja Baaraat and Rocky Aur Rani Kii Prem Kahani, but our munda is sabto vadda (his tagline in the film) and does one better than what he did in Manmarziyan. Not once did it feel like he was copying anyone, and he is the livewire that keeps the film from tipping into unwatchable. And who knew he could move like that?! When put in a scene with the other two actors —- Triptii Dimri, who plays the woman in question Saloni, and Ammy Virk, who plays the other father Gurbir — Kaushal clearly dominates the screen. Not that Dimri is too bad herself, though she seems a little stiff in the comic scenes.The story, written by Ishita Moitra and Tarun Dudeja and directed by Anand Tiwari, is narrated by Dimri to Ananya Panday, who plays herself. It is of a superfast romance (honestly I didn’t even realise when flirting had become serious) and marriage between Akhil and Saloni and an equally fast divorce. Saloni, a chef, wants to earn a Meraki star but is constantly overwhelmed by Akhil’s over-the-top gestures that include barging into her work place with gifts and getting into fights with clients. She is also unhappy about his over/attachment to his mother who calls every hour during their honeymoon.

After the divorce she moves to Mussoorie to work at a Gujarati restaurant and meets owner Gurbir, who comes across as timid but is more mature than Akhil. One vengeful drinking session later, she is forcing Gurbir to have sex with her. While it is great to see a woman taking the lead, would it have been funny if it was a woman who kept saying, let's do this some other time, to a drunk man who insisted on having sex then and there? Just asking ‘do I have your consent’ before forcing sex on a clearly interested but reluctant person does not make one woke. Add on top of that the fact that she was having sex as a way to fight back against her ex-husband moving on (which Indian nari could have a one-night stand just because she feels lust?) makes Gurbir feel more used than equal.Saloni ends up also having sex with Akhil, who shows up as a surprise, on the same night and it is great that the film doesn’t make any hullabaloo about it. But the fallout is a difficult-to-pronounce miracle where both Akhil and Gurbir turn out to be fathers of one twin each. What follows is a comic one-upmanship to make sure that they are the one chosen. And the film, which has a woman at the centre, becomes all about the two men. I mean they do realise at the end that the choice of not just who the father will be but also about the children’s future is up to the woman, but by then she has become the third wheel of the film. In fact, the only person who gets a whole character arc is Kaushal, who traverses the gamut from spoilt, rich mama’s boy to an adult who can be selfless, even if still a bit juvenile.

The film is not unfunny per say but most of the jokes involve so much name dropping and referencing other films and characters and settings that it is easy to forget what film you are watching. There is hardly any scope for original dialogues when every other line is a song or a reference from another movie. And why is the background score so loud and brash that one wishes there was a mute button option at the movie hall.

What’s paisa vasool is seeing Vicky Kaushal dance, not just in the Tauba tauba song before the credits but also the opening song. Basically, you can watch the first 10 minutes and last five minutes and call it a job well done, if you are a Vicky Kaushal fan. Otherwise, it’s ‘bad newz’ for you my friend.","""Bad Newz"" centers on Saloni, played by Triptii Dimri, who becomes pregnant with twins from two men: Vicky Kaushal's lively Akhil and Ammy Virk's mature Gurbir. Directed by Anand Tiwari, the film blends comedy with a complex romantic plot, overshadowed by Kaushal's standout performance. Despite its humor and unique premise, the film struggles with derivative humor and a focus that shifts away from its central female character, leaving Kaushal's character the most developed.",Entertainment,73,751
DNA,2024-08-28 00:00:00,"UEFA Champions League 2024-25: All you need to know about group stage draw, date, time, teams and new format","The highly anticipated UEFA Champions League is set to make its return with the group stage draw scheduled to take place at the prestigious Grimaldi Forum in Monaco on Thursday, August 29, 2024. This upcoming season will see a departure from the traditional format, as the tournament will now feature a new 36-team single group format. While this format may be longer, it promises to bring more excitement and allow for a greater number of clubs to participate.

Supporters of top clubs such as Arsenal, Manchester City, Real Madrid, and Paris Saint-Germain are eagerly anticipating how their favorite teams will fare in this revamped UCL format. 
The previous group-stage format, which had been in place for 21 seasons, has been replaced with a new single-standings league system. In this new format, 36 teams will compete, each playing eight games against eight different opponents from January through March.

The top eight teams in the standings at the end of the league phase will advance directly to the round of 16 in March. Teams ranked ninth to 24th will compete in knockout playoffs in February to secure their spot in the next round. Unfortunately, the bottom 12 teams will be eliminated from the competition.

During the playoffs, teams ranked 9th through 16th are seeded to play second legs at home against unseeded teams ranked 17th through 24th. This seeding system ensures a fair and competitive match-up for all teams involved.

How will the draw be done?

The 36 teams have been divided into four seeding pots based on their ""UEFA club coefficient,"" which reflects their performance in European competitions over the past five years. The top-seeded pot includes recent Champions League winners and finalists, as well as Leipzig and Barcelona.

Once a team's ball is drawn, a software program will quickly allocate its eight opponents - two from each seeding pot, with one match to be played at home and one away.

Match dates will be finalized on Saturday to prevent scheduling conflicts with Europa League and Conference League games, which will be drawn on Friday in Monaco. The Conference League, a 36-team single-standings league, consists of teams that play only six games.

Winning prize

The Statesman,2024-10-14 00:00:00,Central Banks should remain prepared to navigate complex challenges: Shaktikanta Das,"Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Shaktikanta Das Monday said the central banks must remain vigilant, adaptable, continuously assess risks and build resilience.

“They should remain prepared to navigate complex challenges, support sustainable growth, maintain price stability and promote sound and vibrant financial systems,” he said.

Addressing a conference in New Delhi, the Governor said, “As we navigate the high intensity tail events and black swans of the current decade, the lessons imbibed can well form the basis of our deliberations today to chart out a course for the future.”

He said the divergence in global monetary policies – monetary easing in some economies, tightening in a few, and pause in several other economies – can be expected to lead to volatility in capital flows and exchange rates, which may disrupt financial stability.

Secondly, the private credit markets have expanded rapidly with limited regulation. They pose significant risks to financial stability, particularly since they have not been stress-tested in a downturn, he said.

Further, the higher interest rates, aimed at curtailing inflationary pressures, have led to increase in debt servicing costs, financial market volatility, and risks to asset quality.

Stretched asset valuations in some jurisdictions could trigger contagion across financial markets, creating further instability.

“The correction in commercial real estate (CRE) prices in some jurisdictions can put small and medium-sized banks under stress, given their large exposures to this sector,” he said.

The interconnectedness between CRE, non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), and the broader banking system amplifies these risks, he added.

The Governor said the Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) is another area which has the potential to facilitate efficient cross-border payments.

“Programmability, interoperability with the UPI retail fast payment system and development of offline solutions for remote areas and underserved segments of the population, are some of the value added services which we are now experimenting as part of our CBDC pilot.”","RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized the need for central banks to stay vigilant and adaptable in navigating the challenges of today’s financial landscape. Speaking in New Delhi, he urged central banks to assess risks continuously, maintain financial stability, and promote sustainable growth. Das highlighted the divergence in global monetary policies—some countries easing, tightening, or pausing policies—warning that it could lead to volatile capital flows and exchange rates, which might disrupt financial systems.

He expressed concerns about the rapid expansion of private credit markets with limited regulation, which could pose risks to financial stability, particularly as they haven’t been stress-tested during economic downturns. Additionally, higher interest rates to curb inflation have raised debt servicing costs and increased market volatility, which could strain asset quality.

Das also pointed out that falling commercial real estate prices in some areas could put small and medium-sized banks under stress, given their exposure to this sector. He emphasized the interconnected risks between real estate, non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), and the broader banking system.

On Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), he noted that India is exploring their potential for efficient cross-border payments and is experimenting with programmability, interoperability, and offline solutions for underserved areas as part of its CBDC pilot.",Business and Finance,203,312
The telegraph,2024-06-30 00:00:00,"Out, proud and loud: Members of Kolkata’s LGBTQIA+ community on what Pride Month means to them","Pride Month stands for a community’s fight for basic rights. Celebrated all throughout the month of June around the world, Pride Month also raises awareness about the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community, shedding light on the stereotypes and stigmas that the community faces.

As June draws to a close, My Kolkata reached out to members of the queer community for their thoughts on Pride Month and the challenges they continue to face. Excerpts…
‘Queer people remain queer all through the year’
Bishan Samaddar, editor at Seagull Books, is proud of his identity. Bishan helms the Pride Literature section of Seagull Books, which gives him the chance to meet people with diverse stories and backgrounds. “To me, Pride Month is important because it marks the progress that has been made in securing LGBTQ+ rights and visibility across the board in our society. It is, at the same time, a reminder of how much more needs to be done to achieve a semblance of equality,” believes Bishan.

Societal evolution and acceptance of members of the LGBTQIA+ community into the mainstream during the Pride Month is something that he takes note of. “But, I must say that this must extend to every month of the year — not the celebrations or the parties, but the recognition, the acceptance, the equal treatment. Because we queer people remain queer all through the year,” he said.Bishan is breaking stereotypes in his own way. “Most queer people are just as 'normal' as straight people. More focus should be on queer people leading their lives successfully in conventional jobs or careers. This will send out the message that queer people are like everyone else in most ways and they are every walk of life, contributing to society,” he says.

‘My sexuality or gender is not my whole identity’
“There's a list of stereotypes I can give you that are associated with the queer community,” said Dr. Abubakar Parvez. The doctor shared how queers are often thought to be indecent, available and desperate for sex.

Awwboo, as he is affectionately called, believes “This age-old idea of queers being ‘desperate’ and ‘available’ subjects us to a different kind of discrimination and injustice. Our personal space is not respected because apparently, we don't need one. But how do I explain that it's a fundamental right and we do respect it as much as we want it to be respected?” Awwboo asks.

To him, his identity is much more than the labels and attributions. “Coming to the point of indecency, year after year, queers have been oppressed for their expression of identity, sexuality and gender. It definitely comes off as a defence mechanism where people are as loud as they can be, to prove and show that they exist,” he said.

Out, proud and loud, the doctor is a vociferous advocate of establishing one’s identity. “My sexuality or gender is not my whole identity. I have created a whole different world of my own where these are important aspects of my life, but never the whole of it,” he says.

‘We cannot ignore that queer identities are invisibilised’
For Gourab Ghosh, Pride Month has a specific meaning — standing up against oppression. “We cannot ignore that queer identities are invisibilised,” said Gourab, as he spoke about how Pride Month is celebrated in the month of June all over the world to remember a particular watershed moment in the global LGBTQIA+ movement. The educator further remembers the Stonewall Uprising that happened in 1969 in New York City.

“To make yourselves visible, one of the ways is to remember and re-remember the history of oppression and resistance of the queer people,” opined the rights activist.

“All effeminate or feminine men are not gay” — states Gourab, clearing one of the most common stereotypes. Another societal understanding regarding transgenders is also something that he wants to clear. “Transgender is an umbrella term under which there are a lot of other identities. I would want people to actually understand what transidentity is,” says Gourab.

‘Many believe that gay relationships put society in jeopardy’
For filmmaker Debalina Majumdar, Pride Month signifies celebrating their existence. A special date or a month denotes the importance of an event. The queer rights activist breaks the shackles through her films and documentaries — addressing various notions associated with the LGBTQIA+ community. “Any news related to the queer community on social media draws flak in the comments section, which further says a lot about the prevalent societal understanding,” says Debalina.

Debalina has come across misinformed comments on how the queer community in particular is ‘sex-starved’. The other understanding is “how society believes that gay relationships are a hindrance to progeny, thereby putting society in jeopardy” says Debalina. “It is an allegation towards the queer community, which is accompanied by the understanding that this community is perverse,” shared Debalina, who has made a documentary called Gay India Matrimony, which addresses various aspects of queer relationships.

‘Pride is a celebration of the freedom to live our lives the way we want, without discrimination’
Thirty-year-old professional make-up artist Biplab Das believes Pride Month is important because it is necessary to remember the past and the fact that people fought for the rights of the queer community, and paved the way for the way things are today. “It wasn’t always this free and comfortable for us. Pride Month celebrates our existence in society,” he said. He believes we should mark this just the way we would mark Independence Day, because Pride Month “is the celebration of the queer community’s freedom to live our lives exactly the way we wish to — without being discriminated against, bullied or judged”.

When it comes to stereotypes, Biplab thinks it is time people stopped ‘sex-shaming’ members of the LGBTQIA+ community. He feels society often finds them an easy target and assumes everyone queer is promiscuous. “People think we are all about sex. It is hard for them to understand that our choices or way of living is no different. They tend to judge a gay, trans or bi person simply on the preconceived notion that they are all about sex without knowing anything else about their lives.” He would like to see this mindset change and for people to stop judging anyone simply on their sexuality.

‘Pride is a celebration of everything we are, have been, and are deemed to be’
“If prejudice is deeply ingrained, the shame that results from experiencing that prejudice is ingrained many levels deeper,"" says Aavash Tulsyan. The entrepreneur and teacher believes that being ridiculed, teased, or harassed due to one's gender expression or sexual identity is, unfortunately, far too common. “Our skin is part Teflon, part scar tissue, and part broken glass. Pride is a celebration of everything we are, have been, and are deemed to be because we are so gorgeously unique,” he says.

“Pride is because we are, despite everything and everyone in our lives that has asked us to be otherwise,"" says the 29-year-old.

Aavash believes in breaking the stereotypes associated with the LGBTQIA+ community. Name-calling or stigmatising the queer individuals, calling them “sexual deviants, perverts, and predatory,” need to be put on a halt. “This notion is far too prevalent, particularly among men and women wrestling with their own insecurities and having trouble looking beyond the confines of externally enforced gender roles,” says Aavash.

Children growing up around members of the LGBTQIA+ community does not affect the young minds’ understanding — another prevalent notion that he wants to bust. “Having us around your children will not mess with their heads. In all likelihood, your kids will grow up with an appreciation of perspectives and realities that vary from their own, or they might recognise who they really are in the courage that we display,"" says Aavash.

The Arunachal times ,2024-10-09 00:00:00,Ziro Butterfly Meet concludes,"ZIRO, 8 Oct: Over 60 butterfly species, including the Bhutan Glory, the brown gorgon, and 52 bird species were recorded during the 11th Ziro Butterfly Meet (ZBM), which concluded at Pange, Tale Wildlife Sanctuary, on Tuesday.

The event also marked over a decade of efforts to promote biodiversity conservation and ecotourism in Arunachal Pradesh.

Initiated in 2014, the meet has steadily grown into a platform that not only celebrates the region’s rich natural heritage but also actively involves local communities in safeguarding the environment.

From its humble beginnings, the Ziro Butterfly Meet has transformed into a renowned event that attracts nature enthusiasts, conservationists, and students from across the state. The meet has grown in both scale and impact, with the number of participants and species recorded increasing year after year, event organiser Ngunu Ziro said in a release.

“What began as a local conservation initiative has now become a vital annual programme, fostering environmental awareness and creating opportunities for ecotourism. Over the years, the meet has also incorporated activities such as workshops, nature walks, and training sessions for nature guides, making it a holistic experience for all participants,” NgunuZiro secretary Punyo Chada said.

Speaking at the valedictory function, Hapoli Division DFO Nani Shah praised the growth of the event and its role in environmental education. He encouraged the participants to continue engaging in such programmes, and to spread the message of conservation within their communities.

Former Deputy Commissioner Bamin Nime highlighted the event’s significance in promoting the dignity of labour and community-driven efforts toward sustainability.

The Ziro Butterfly Meet’s success over the past 11 years can be attributed to the strong partnership between local communities, conservationists, and government officials.

NgunuZiro has played a pivotal role in mobilising resources and support, ensuring that the meet continues to grow and make a positive impact.

As the Ziro Butterfly Meet steps into its second decade, it remains committed to its mission of creating a future where conservation and community involvement go hand in hand. The event will continue to inspire, educate and engage, contributing to the preservation of Ziro’s unique biodiversity for generations to come, the release said.

The event was organised in collaboration with the environment and the Hapoli forest division as part of the National Wildlife Week.","The 11th Ziro Butterfly Meet recorded over 60 butterfly species and 52 bird species at Tale Wildlife Sanctuary, promoting biodiversity conservation and ecotourism. Initiated in 2014, the event has grown into a renowned platform involving local communities.

Hindustan times,2024-09-10 00:00:00,"‘We will fight for you, Kolkata sister’","When a young woman was gang-raped and left to die on the streets of New Delhi in 2012, a shocked and enraged India vowed that her death would not be in vain, that she would be avenged by not letting this happen to “anyone else”.
The raped and murdered woman doctor in Kolkata’s RG Kar Hospital is that “anyone else.”
In India, men continue to rape women with impunity. In a corrupt, dishonest system, they know they can normally bribe their way out of it.

This said, the Kolkata rape-murder case is about much more than correcting systemic corruption in India, or about demanding institutional accountability for what was done to a doctor that night, who happened to be a woman.

It’s puzzling that the Supreme Court of India, even as it takes “suo moto” cognisance of this case, regards it primarily as a matter of doctors’ safety, and not of women’s safety.

The rape-murder at RG Kar is about what was done to a woman that night, who happened to be a doctor. A woman’s safety is her right, and it’s about much more than installing CCTV cameras and high-tech security systems in hospitals or other work environments. After all, think about the lakhs of women in India who’re raped in non-institutional places, in public spaces, or in domestic settings—including their own homes.
Rape is primarily about power, predation and dominion: Men who rape women do so to feel powerful, in control and superior. That’s why they often rape in gangs and choose soft targets--girl children or, as in the RG Kar case, a young woman in deep sleep.

Put another way, there exists a huge disparity of power between men and women across almost all spheres of life in India. Men rape to perpetuate this power imbalance—to demean and to oppress their female victims. And they often get away with it because of a patriarchal power structure--that largely understands, supports, condones, and shield its own kind--at the expense of the other.
It’s fallacious to couch rape—any rape—as primarily a matter of protecting women. For it leads to scare-mongering and controlling women, and to scaling back hard-won women’s rights and liberties. And to exhorting women to talk, dress and behave ‘appropriately’ so that they do no ‘invite trouble’ from men. And to blaming them for not staying at home--for being ‘too ambitious’. And to shaming them for not being ‘smart and strong enough’ to detect danger and defend themselves against their assaulters--with pepper sprays or martial arts or ‘one tight slap’ or even guns and revolvers!
Equally, to couch rape primarily as a matter of ‘swiftly and severely’ punishing the perpetrators is not enough. The Kolkata rape case is about much more than the proper implementation of existing laws and policies to deal with sexual violence, or about making newer and stronger ones that are ‘anti-rape’. Those in power know this. But they play to the gallery, pass the buck, and serve their own self-interested agenda, rather than bring justice to the raped and killed woman per se.

So, how can justice truly be served to a woman who’s been raped and killed? What is justice, especially if finding and punishing the rapists isn’t all there is to it? If deterring future perpetrators with the fear of the law isn’t all there is to it? If justice is about more than retribution, if it’s about how we value people and things, then the first step is to appreciate that the blame and shame is also somewhat our own—even as it’s of the actual perpetrators. For ours is a society that routinely subordinates women and makes them to settle for less. It’s a culture that regularly privileges men to the detriment of women.

Men enjoy this privilege and advantage and won’t give it up easily, or on their own—despite the lip-service. For gender justice to prevail, power must be seized and redistributed, because it won’t be proffered just like that.

That’s why real justice for the dead doctor is for women from all walks of life, and non-political affiliations, to continue protesting across India--to come out in her support, and to keep demanding deep social change.
And, as that gets done, it’s for women to embody the deep social change they demand. Women win when women take care of each other. Justice triumphs when women unite and stand up for each other; when women empower other women instead of competing against each other; and when they raise boys/men who regard women as different but equal, and not the other.
","The Kolkata rape-murder case highlights systemic issues of gender-based violence in India, emphasizing that justice must extend beyond punishment to address deep-rooted power imbalances. It critiques the focus on women's safety as merely about institutional measures and calls for societal change. True justice involves solidarity among women and challenging patriarchal norms, ensuring a cultural shift toward gender equality.",Crime and Justice,58,759
DNA (Daily News and Analysis),2024-09-24 00:00:00,"This Indian car brand set to acquire 50% stake in Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, deal will cost Rs…","In a major development that may redefine the automotive market in India, Mahindra & Mahindra is said to have entered into late stage talks to acquire a 50% stake in Skoda Auto Volkswagen India. Estimated at between Rs 66,00,00,00,000 (USD 800 million) and Rs 83,00,00,00,000 (USD 1 billion)  this potential partnership is expected to be sealed shortly with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).

The deal is being struck as both firms look to strengthen their standing in India’s fast-growing market for electric vehicles (EVs). Mahindra wants to tap into Skoda Auto Volkswagen’s global technology and production line, while Skoda expects to gain from Mahindra’s low-cost vehicle platforms like New Flexible Architecture (NFA) that can accommodate both internal combustion engine (ICE) and Electric vehicles (EVs).

Reports suggests that talks have been difficult, which has seen the value placed on the company lowered from the earlier Rs 1,67,00,00,00,000 (USD 2 billion). It is envisaged that Mahindra’s investment would be both cash and non-cash, with the goal of increasing production capacity at Chakan. At present, the Skoda Auto Volkswagen India has an installed production capacity of approximately 210,000 automobiles per annum and has the potential to increase this capacity in the future.

This could add a lot of value to Mahindra’s production capacity and once integrated with Skoda, Mahindra could easily produce over one million vehicles per year. In exchange, Skoda will get Mahindra’s lower-cost platforms which would be very useful in creating models such as Kushaq and Taigun.

The European carmaker has failed to achieve sales targets in India and is now seeking to find a way of sharing risks of investment while at the same time improving profitability in a growing competitive market.

In addition, this partnership supports Skoda’s long-term plans to meet new regulations that will be implemented in the future including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) norms for 2028. These regulations will call for capital intensive investment in the EV technologies, which makes it particularly strategic to partner with a local player like Mahindra.","In a significant development for the Indian automotive market, Mahindra & Mahindra is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire a 50% stake in Skoda Auto Volkswagen India, with the deal valued between Rs 66 billion (USD 800 million) and Rs 83 billion (USD 1 billion). The partnership aims to bolster both companies' positions in India's rapidly expanding electric vehicle (EV) sector. Mahindra seeks to leverage Skoda's global technology and production capabilities, while Skoda aims to benefit from Mahindra's cost-effective vehicle platforms, such as the New Flexible Architecture (NFA), suitable for both internal combustion engines (ICE) and EVs.

Negotiations have been challenging, leading to a decrease in the company's valuation from an earlier Rs 167 billion (USD 2 billion). Mahindra's investment is expected to include both cash and non-cash components, focusing on enhancing production capacity at Skoda's Chakan facility, which currently stands at approximately 210,000 vehicles per year. This partnership could potentially enable Mahindra to produce over one million vehicles annually while providing Skoda with access to lower-cost platforms for models like Kushaq and Taigun.

The collaboration comes as Skoda struggles to meet sales targets in India and seeks to share investment risks while improving profitability in a competitive landscape.

He was referred to as the father of Green Revolution in India, for his leadership and role in introducing and further developing high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice in the country. This resulted in the country's transition from a food grains exporting nation to self-sufficiency in food grain production.
He was commended by Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug as the driving force behind the Green Revolution in Asia. In his letter to Swaminathan, he mentions ""The Green Revolution has been a team effort and much of the credit for its spectacular development must go to the Indian officials, organizations, scientists, and farmers. However, to you, Dr. Swaminathan, a great deal of the credit must go for first recognizing the potential value of the Mexican dwarfs. Had this not occurred, it is quite possible that there would not have been a Green Revolution in Asia.""
Some of the important assignments that he tenanted in his illustrious career are Director of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (1961-72), Director General of ICAR and Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Agricultural Research and Education (1972-79), Principal Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture (1979-80), Acting Deputy Chairman and later Member (Science and Agriculture), Planning Commission (1980-82) and Director General, International Rice Research Institute, the Philippines (1982-88). In his later years, he set up the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation from the prize money that he received when he was awarded the First World Food Prize in 1987.

Following the groundwork laid for Kumbh 2019, the city has seen unprecedented development ahead of Maha Kumbh 2025.

With an emphasis on permanent infrastructure, over 200 roads have been newly constructed or upgraded, ensuring seamless connectivity for the millions of devotees expected to attend the grand spiritual gathering.

Adding to the transformation, these roads have been adorned with three lakh plants and one lakh horticultural saplings, enhancing their visual appeal. As devotees flock to Prayagraj for Maha Kumbh, they will not only experience seamless travel, but also take home lasting memories of the city’s beautified and welcoming atmosphere.

In preparation for the grand Maha Kumbh event in Prayagraj, a total of 200 roads have been upgraded to ensure seamless connectivity for devotees. These efforts include construction of new roads as well as widening and strengthening of existing ones, with contributions from three key departments.

The Prayagraj Municipal Corporation has led the effort, successfully reconstructing, widening and strengthening 78 roads. The Public Works Department (PWD) has developed 74 roads, while the Prayagraj Development Authority (PDA) has worked on 48 roads.

Beyond functional improvements, the roads have also been beautified to enhance the city’s appeal. A variety of plants have been thoughtfully placed along the routes, with three lakh plants and one lakh horticultural saplings adorning these upgraded roads.

These enhanced and beautified roads promise to make the journey to the Sangam smooth and spiritually enriching, offering devotees an experience of divine bliss during their visit to Maha Kumbh.

The construction and development of these roads posed significant challenges for the three departments involved. One of the major hurdles was addressing encroachments along the routes. To facilitate smooth construction, a total of 4,426 encroachments were removed, ensuring clear pathways for both devotees and the residents of Prayagraj.

Additionally, legal obstacles were encountered at various sites, with 82 court cases getting resolved to enable the construction process. Infrastructure adjustments also played a critical role, as 4,893 electric poles were successfully relocated to accommodate the roadwork.

Moreover, as part of the development efforts, 170 kilometres of underground cabling were laid alongside the construction of roads, further modernising the city’s infrastructure and enhancing its capacity to host the grand Maha Kumbh.","Prayagraj has undergone a remarkable transformation under the leadership of the Yogi Adityanath government, especially in preparation for the upcoming Maha Kumbh 2025.

Sinwar, 61, spent twenty years in Israeli prisons before returning to Gaza and becoming a top Hamas leader. He played a crucial role in the October 7 attack.
Israeli authorities had placed a $400,000 bounty on Sinwar's capture or death. Despite numerous airstrikes targeting Hamas leaders, he managed to evade capture by hiding in the extensive network of tunnels beneath Gaza.
With Sinwar's death, Hamas faces a leadership crisis.
Several high-ranking figures are seen as potential successors, including:
Mahmoud al-Zahar: A founding member of Hamas, al-Zahar is known for his hardline views and played a significant role in the group's rise to power. 
Mohammed Sinwar: Yahya Sinwar's brother and a longtime military leader in Hamas, Mohammed shares his brother's hardline stance. His leadership could indicate continuity in Hamas's approach, but US officials worry it could complicate peace negotiations.
Mousa Abu Marzouk: A senior member of Hamas's political bureau, Abu Marzouk was involved in establishing the group in the late 1980s. Despite past imprisonment in the US for terrorist activities, he remains influential in Hamas's political operations.
Mohammed Deif: The elusive commander of Hamas's military wing, Deif is credited with masterminding many of Hamas's operations, including the October 7 attack. 
Khalil al-Hayya: Currently based in Qatar, al-Hayya has played a key role in ceasefire negotiations in previous conflicts. His diplomatic skills may provide a more pragmatic approach for Hamas during this ongoing war.
As Hamas looks for new leadership, the group's future direction remains uncertain during this critical phase of the Gaza conflict.
","Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader linked to the October 7 attack on Israel, was killed by Israeli forces, creating a leadership vacuum within Hamas.

It is no exaggeration to say these petitions pose a virulent challenge to the survival of secularism. The outcome may well decide the trajectory of communal relations and the future of secular thought in the country. The 1991 Act does have some exemptions: it did not apply to what was then the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, which ended in favour of the Ram temple. Nor does it apply to monuments, sites and remains covered by the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958. It will also not apply to any suit that has been finally settled or disposed of, any dispute that has been settled by the parties before the 1991 Act came into force, or to the conversion of any place that took place by acquiescence. The challenge has come in the backdrop of a renewed attempt through motivated litigation by some Hindu organisations and devotees to target mosques such as the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi, the Shahi Idgah mosque in Mathura and the Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal, among others. Any order that strikes down or dilutes the 1991 law is likely to have a malign influence on these proceedings.","The Supreme Court of India will hear petitions challenging the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, starting December 12, 2024.

The Asian Age,2024-08-14 00:00:00,Prez Recalls Sacrifices Made to Get Freedom  ,"New Delhi: Freedom comes with a cost. Sacrifices and human tragedy are part of the journey to the pinnacle called Independence. While moving forward, one must also look back to remember those who sacrificed their present for our future and learn from the mistakes of the past, said President Droupadi Murmu in her address to the nation on the eve of the 78th Independence Day. As India gears up to celebrate, President Murmu emphasised the importance of remembering the horrors of Partition that accompanied Independence. She remarked that India's new criminal laws are a tribute to the freedom fighters. The President also highlighted how India has progressed since gaining independence, noting that today it is one of the five largest economies in the world. She praised the country's significant advancements in various sectors and the infrastructural boost of recent years.

“Today, on August 14, the nation observes Vibhajan Vibhishika Smriti Diwas (Partition Horrors Remembrance Day) to recall the horrors of Partition. As our great nation was divided, millions were forced to migrate, and hundreds of thousands lost their lives. A day before we celebrate Independence Day, we remember that unparalleled human tragedy and stand with the families that were torn apart,” said the President. She also highlighted the sacrifices made by freedom fighters

“We are part of a chain that binds the dreams of those who participated in the freedom struggle and the aspirations of those who will witness the nation regaining its full glory in the years to come... Patriotic and brave souls took immense risks and made supreme sacrifices. We salute their memory. Thanks to their unceasing labor, the soul of India awoke from centuries of torpor,” she said. She also mentioned the contributions of tribal leaders in India’s freedom struggle.

Speaking about the present, she highlighted the strides India has taken in various sectors. President Murmu noted that many government schemes have uplifted economically weaker sections, providing free ration and amenities to 80 crore people. She lauded farmers, terming them “Annadata,” for ensuring that agricultural production continues to exceed expectations and for their immense contribution to making India self-reliant in agriculture.

“Infrastructure has received a significant boost in recent years. Strategic planning and effective institutions have helped expand the network of roads and highways, railways, and ports. Considering the great potential of futuristic technology, the government has vigorously promoted a range of sectors, such as semiconductors and Artificial Intelligence, while also creating an ideal ecosystem for startups that will propel their growth. This has made India an even more attractive investment destination. With greater transparency, the banking and financial sector has become much more efficient. All these factors have set the stage for the next generation of economic reforms and growth that will catapult India among the developed nations,” she said. Murmu noted that between 2021 and 2024, India has been among the fastest-growing major economies, with an average annual growth rate of 8 per cent. She described the recently concluded general elections, which had a record 97 crore eligible voters, as a “historic record,” making it the largest electoral exercise humankind has ever witnessed. She added that the Election Commission of India should be congratulated for the smooth and flawless conduct of such a gigantic event. “When such a large number of people exercise their franchise, it is a resounding vote for the idea of democracy. India’s successful conduct of elections strengthens democratic forces around the world,” the President said. She also congratulated the winners of the Paris Olympics and the Indian cricket team for winning the T20 World Cup.

While the former was demolished in 2022, with regard to the latter, the Directorate
General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) is ascertaining the extent of violation.
These details were revealed in response to a query under the Right to Information (RTI)

A query was sought from the Airport Authority of India (AAI), DGCA and HAL seeking
details of how many high rise buildings in Bengaluru are posing obstruction to flight paths
near HAL Airport and the Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) for the last 30 years
(Between 1994 till date).

However, HAL in its response said that there are obstacles like trees, poles, antennas,
towers and buildings.
“In addition, there is a structure constructed adjacent to HAL Airport without NOC for the

The Telegraph,2024-12-31 00:00:00,"India considered, then abandoned, plan to unseat Maldives's pro-China President: Washington Post","In a move that reflects the delicate balancing of regional power, India briefly mulled a covert strategy to remove Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu after his election in late 2023, The Washington Post reports.
Muizzu’s promise to expel Indian troops and strengthen ties with China presented a significant challenge to India’s influence in the Maldives – a critical partner in the Indian Ocean region. The stakes were high, as the Maldives sits on vital maritime routes, making it a flashpoint in the ongoing rivalry between India and China.
According to The Washington Post, India’s intelligence agency, R&AW, explored a plan called the ""Democratic Renewal Initiative"" to oust Muizzu.
There was no immediate response from the government to the report, but the publication noted that it had previously declined to comment.
The plan involved bribing 40 members of the Maldivian parliament, including members of Muizzu’s own party, to vote for his impeachment. It also aimed to secure support from senior military and police officers, as well as criminal gangs, to ensure success. The operation’s estimated cost: $6 million, which India was expected to bankroll.
“By January 2024, agents acting on behalf of R&AW began quietly discussing with Maldivian opposition leaders the possibility of removing Muizzu,” The Washington Post reported.
Both India and China view the Maldives as a key piece in their broader regional strategies. For India, keeping the Maldives in its sphere is essential for both economic stability and security. A stronger Chinese presence there could have lasting implications for India’s maritime interests.
In the weeks following the initial planning, Opposition politicians in the Maldives put together detailed plans to bribe 40 parliamentarians, including some from Muizzu’s party, to vote for his impeachment.
The plan also called for payments to 10 senior army and police officers and three influential criminal gangs to ensure the President’s removal. To fund the operation, conspirators sought 87 million Maldivian rufiyaa, or $6 million, with India expected to provide the money.
However, after months of deliberation, the effort failed to gather enough parliamentary support, and India ultimately decided to back away from funding or pursuing the plan, The Washington Post reported. Analysts believed the risks of destabilising the Maldives and damaging diplomatic ties outweighed any potential benefits.
One Maldivian politician who regularly met with the Indian Embassy in Male revealed that the resident R&AW intelligence officer had expressed personal doubts about the viability of impeachment.
“Indian officials feared that removing a newly elected President might destabilise the Maldives, an already fragile and politically unstable country vulnerable to religious extremism,” the newspaper reported.
Mohamed Aslam, a member of the Opposition MDP and former Speaker of parliament, emphasised to The Washington Post, “India doesn’t want to see a neighbouring country go bankrupt. If the economy collapses, it could trigger other problems, like extremism.”
The decision reflected India’s cautious strategy of managing its rivalry with China without resorting to direct confrontation, analysts said.
This episode underscored the fierce competition for influence in the Indian Ocean. China has made significant strides in the Maldives through its Belt and Road Initiative, funding major infrastructure projects, such as a $200 million bridge, the newspaper said.
These projects have raised concerns in New Delhi about the potential for Chinese military or surveillance operations on the island nation.
India, traditionally a close ally of the Maldives, had backed pro-India leaders like Mohamed Nasheed and Ibrahim Solih. But with Muizzu’s election, India found itself facing new challenges in the region.
Both China and India view the Maldives as a strategic asset, using loans, infrastructure projects, and political leverage to advance their interests. For India, maintaining stability and influence in the Maldives is critical, not only for economic reasons but also for its security in the Indian Ocean.
India's attempts to counter Muizzu included support for the Opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) during the 2023 elections, with Indian poll analysts and campaign workers reportedly assisting the MDP. However, when the MDP lost, India was forced to reconsider its strategy. After Muizzu’s victory, Indian officials explored potential ways to remove him from power. However, these efforts failed due to the lack of sufficient parliamentary support.
Muizzu alarmed Indian officials soon after his election by making his first state visit to Turkiye with which India has not altogether friendly relations. His second trip was a highly publicised state visit to China where he met with President Xi Jinping and other senior leaders.
By late 2024, Muizzu appeared to shift his position, calling India a “valued partner” during a state visit to New Delhi. In response, India pledged to assist the Maldives with military and defence projects, signalling a thaw in relations.
Observers suggest that Muizzu’s softened stance was driven more by economic realities than outside pressure, as the Maldives heavily relies on Indian financial aid and trade.
One unnamed member of Muizzu’s party explained, “The President reversed course not out of fear, but out of fiscal necessity.”
Earlier in 2024 the State Bank of India deferred $100 million in debt payments giving Muizzu financial breathing space. China, however, indicated that it would not make similar concessions. The Maldives has debt of over $8 billion to China and India – this amounts to 120 per cent of its GDP.","India briefly considered a covert plan to oust Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, fearing his pro-China stance. The $6 million initiative failed due to insufficient parliamentary support and potential risks. Despite initial tensions, Muizzu later called India a ""valued partner,"" driven by fiscal needs as the Maldives relies heavily on Indian aid.",Politics,51,870

Pattabhipuram police deployed three teams and based on cellphone signals, they identified the accused and reached Rajeev Gruhakalpa and found both girls in different rooms with Gopi and Manikanta. A case on charges of kidnapping the girls was registered against the accused. Gopi, who works as driver for a Special Branch CI, befriended one of the girls just five days ago.

the hitavada,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Khedkar’s mother held in land dispute case,"A COURT in Maharashtra’s Pune district on Thursday remanded Manorama Khedkar, mother of IAS probationer Puja Khedkar, in police custody till July 20 after she was arrested for allegedly threatening some persons with a gun over a land dispute. Manorama was apprehended from a lodge in Mahad in Raigad district in the morning. She was hiding there, police said. Manorama was then brought to the Paud police station in Pune district and placed under arrest. She was produced before a local court which remanded her in police custody till July 20, said an official. Police had launched a search for Manorama and her husband Dilip Khedkar after a video surfaced showing her allegedly threatening some persons with a gun over a land dispute at Dhadwali village in Pune’s Mulshi tehsil.
 
The Paud police in Pune rural have booked the Khedkar couple and five others under the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita (BNS) sections, including 323 (dishonest or fraudulent removal or concealment of property), and the Arms Act. “Manorama Khedkar was apprehended from Mahad in Raigad district and she was brought to Paud where, after the completion of formalities, she was placed under arrest,” Superintendent of Police, Pune Rural, Pankaj Deshmukh, had said earlier. Puja Khedkar is under scrutiny for her claims regarding disability and Other Backward Class (OBC) certificates in her Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) candidature, as well as her conduct during her tenure at the Pune collector’s office. Amid the row, the government on Tuesday put on hold the ‘district training programme’ of Puja Khedkar, who was earlier transferred to Washim as a supernumerary assistant collector from Pune, as she was summoned back to the Mussoorie-based Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration for “necessary action”.
 
The Pune Anti-Corruption Bureau unit has received a complaint seeking an open inquiry against Puja Khedkar’s father Dilip Khedkar, a retired government official, in connection with alleged disproportionate assets, a senior official said on Wednesday. There is already an inquiry underway by the ACB’s Nashik division against him into the alleged disproportionate assets. Hence, the Pune unit of the anti-graft agency has sought directions from the ACB headquarters to either incorporate the fresh complaint into the ongoing probe or whether to conduct a separate open inquiry, the official said.","The Pune Anti-Corruption Bureau unit has received a complaint seeking an open inquiry against Puja Khedkar’s father Dilip Khedkar, a retired government official, in connection with alleged disproportionate assets, a senior official said on Wednesday.

Indian Express,2024-12-29 00:00:00,"Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi fondly remember Shyam Benegal at his memorial meet: ‘Shyam used every moment of his life in a creative pursuit…’","Days after filmmaker Shyam Benegal passed away, his actor friends Shabana Azmi and Naseeruddin Shah on Saturday fondly recalled his “wide, warm smile” and how he stayed true in his pursuit as a creative person.

At a memorial service at Y B Chavan Centre in south Mumbai, several film industry people, including Azmi, Shah, Javed Akhtar, Kulbhushan Kharbanda, Ila Arun, Prahlad Kakkar, Urmila Matondkar, Divya Dutta, gathered to honour Benegal.
""The first image I’ve of Shyam Benegal was in 1973 and what struck me about him the most was his wide, warm smile as I went to visit him at ASP office where he was the creative director and was looking for cast for Ankur.

“The last image I’ve of Shyam was on December 14, 2024, when he, Nira and Pia had organised a celebration for his 90th birthday. After spending a beautiful hour with us, he was whisked away with that same warm wide smile,” Azmi said.

The filmmaker passed away on December 23 after suffering from a chronic kidney disease.

What Shyam Benegal said about making one of the most difficult films of his career

Shabana Azmi, who collaborated with Shyam Benegal on films like Ankur, Nishant, Junoon, Susman, and Antarnaad, shared an anecdote about Benegal’s personal life.

“Not many people know that Shyam Benegal was a romantic man. He got to know that Nira loves yellow flowers, so the day they got married, he sent her a bouquet of yellow flowers and a message written on it saying, ‘Only 23 hours.’ Then the bouquet kept coming every hour till they got married. Can you imagine? If I were Nira, I would’ve postponed the marriage, it was so lovely,” Azmi added.

Naseeruddin Shah, who worked with Shyam Benegal on classic movies like Nishant, Manthan and Mandi, said the filmmaker stayed true in his pursuit as a creative person.

“Death is the unimportant part of life and what’s important is what you do with the time you’ve. It is undeniable that Shyam used every single moment of his life, breath and iota of energy in a creative pursuit of some kind or the other,” he said.

At the memorial service, Atul Tiwari gifted Shyam Benegal’s wife Nira and daughter Pia Benegal a book he had penned on the late director, Mentor.

Kakkar said he admired Benegal for how he inspired everyone around him, from actors to writers.

“His method was that if you are ever going to be a filmmaker, you could not have a designation, you could never say, ‘This is not my problem’. That’s the one thing he taught us, that everything to do with films, from serving food to cooking to cleaning to supervising carpenters to sitting with writers, everything is your job.

“I could never imagine his great generosity of spirit, and his capacity to teach, mentor and inspire. I’ve seen him inspiring actors, writers and people around him to perform on what they could do. That’s the greatest gift to all of us,” he said.

Shabana Azmi said she considered Shyam Benegal her mentor and often sought his suggestions on the offers she received as an actor.

“Shyam Benegal was my guru, although a reluctant one. He didn’t want to be called anyone’s guru, but nevertheless he was my guru. He was my guru not only because he was my first director but by being around him I learnt so many lessons of life.

“He was my mentor. I consulted him every now and then about a project that I should do or not. He wanted neither to be my guru nor my mentor. He was my friend, and equal and he created that space for this friendship. He gave me equal respect and ability to stand,” Azmi recalled.","Shabana Azmi and Naseeruddin Shah fondly remembered filmmaker Shyam Benegal at a memorial service, recalling his warm smile, dedication to his craft, and mentorship.

the orissa post,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Voters & ideology,"the question of ideology in Indian politics has been debated and dismissed for a long time. Writing for the New York Times, the American political pundit Anand Giridharadas dismisses Indian elections as one being without “ideology, larger-than-life leaders, causes or principles.” The flaw in the first part of Giridharadas’ argument is instantly recognisable to anyone with even a rudimentary awareness of Indian politics. The popularity of leaders like J Jayalalithaa, MG Ramachandran, NT Rama Rao and arguably even Jawaharlal Nehru has been at least in part due to their perception of being larger-than-life personalities. The question of ideology, on the other hand, is much more complex.

India has witnessed unlikely coalitions among the socialists and the Hindu nationalists during the emergency to rout Indira Gandhi in the immediate aftermath of Emergency. Similarly, the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) both provided outside support to the National Front government under VP Singh. In recent years, the unlikely alliance between the Congress and the Hindu nationalist Shiv Sena in Maharashtra further bolsters the argument for the irrelevancy of ideology in Indian politics.","

The councillors complain that they are not given prior information about the subject of resolutions and they are passed without debate or discussion in the meeting. The DMK and its alliance parties have a strength of 96 councillors, while AIADMK has three councillors and an independent councillor makes up the rest. Thanks to the huge majority, a majority of the resolutions are passed without opposition.

The performance of Mayor Ranganayaki has come under the lens as councillors say she just passes all resolutions without putting them to debate. “We are asked to give opinions on the resolutions only after they are passed, and there is commotion every month. We raise doubts, giving suggestions and opposing resolutions without any order. Even officials who are present in the meeting are confused about which resolution or subject we are speaking about,” said a councillor who did not wish to be identified.

Apart from this, councillors say they are not given enough opportunities and time to speak during the council meetings. AIADMK floor leader R Prabhakaran of AIADMK, who was suspended on Monday after he staged a protest, told TNIE, “None of our opinions are heard in the meeting. The mayor and DMK members pass resolutions at their own will without debate or discussion. A councillor must be given 10-15 minutes to speak.

The Telegraph,2025-01-02 00:00:00,Gautam Gambhir refuses to confirm Rohit Sharma's place in playing XI of final Test against Australia,"the question was simple. Will Rohit Sharma play in the fth and nal Test
against Australia? Had Sharma's position been secure, the answer should have
been ""Yes."" Yet, India head coach Gautam Gambhir's response at a pre-match
press conference was: ""We will take a call on the playing XI after looking at the
pitch."" The ambiguous response, equal parts intriguing and dramatic, naturally
sparked speculation that the out-of-form skipper was no longer sure of his place
in the playing XI.
Within few hours, it swirled into near conrmation that the 37-year-old Rohit is
set to become the rst serving Indian captain who would be dropped for poor
form. And it all began with one line.
Ever since he landed Down Under, Rohit the batter has been battered by extra
bounce and seam movement and Rohit the skipper has been left bruised by the
scathing criticism of his leadership.And as the tour draws to a close, his career as a Test cricketer seems headed for a
dispiriting climax.
Rohit, just like in Melbourne, was last among recognised batters to enter the nets,
and if he is dropped he would have no one to blame except the abysmal return of
31 runs from ve innings.
If the expected happens, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who has been the team's
top performer with an astonishing 30 wickets in four outings at a sub-20 average,
will take over the leadership role. It was under Bumrah's captaincy that India won
its only Test on the tour so far -- the lung-opener in Perth.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Anil Kumble walked into Test retirements mid-series
as their bodies could no longer take the rigours of the longest format.
However, in Rohit's case, he will be dropped on the basis of form after Gambhir
made it clear that performance is the only thing that would keep a player in the
dressing room helmed by him.
If he doesn't come out for toss on Friday, it would be safe to conclude that Rohit
played his last knock at the MCG earlier this week where he looked completely out
of place on a good track.
While Gambhir didn't spell out the playing eleven, there were enough indications
that India might bring back Shubman Gill at number three.
""Indian cricket's transition is in safe hands as long as there are honest people in
the dressing room. Only criteria to be in that dressing room is performance,""
Gambhir said at the pre-match press conference.
Trailing 1-2, a win for Australia will seal their place in the nal at the Lord's
against South Africa in the World Test Championship.
India, on other hand, not only require a win but also need Sri Lanka to not lose
any of their two Tests at home against Pat Cummins' men to qualify for the WTC
nals.
The visitors aren't looking like a team at ease right now, especially Rohit, who is
caught between a rock and a hard place both as skipper and batter.
He may or may not announce retirement but playing the traditional format after
Sydney looks a long shot.
Add to this the murmurs of dissension in the team that could have a bearing on
how the players perform.
The implosion started with Ravichandran Ashwin retiring and going back home
midway through the series and Rohit's poor form has certainly made him lose a
bit of command.
Rishabh in the line of re
There are reports that Rishabh Pant's shot selection has invited the wrath of
Gambhir, who is now planning a rap on the knuckles by dropping him in favour of
Dhruv Jurel.
If Pant is indeed axed from the game, it would be a redux of the time when
legendary all-rounder Kapil Dev was taught a lesson for his poor shot selection during a 1984 tour of England with a similar omission.
During practice on Thursday, Jurel got the same net time as his senior.
When an Australian reporter asked if had some stern words for the boys post the
184-run drubbing in Melbourne, Gambhir didn't deny having an ""honest
conversation"" and also stressed on the need to play for the team's cause.
Pant was also seen engaged in a long conversation with vice captain Jasprit
Bumrah.
India will also have to make one change owing to Akash Deep's stiff back that has
forced him out.
The coach's favourite Harshit Rana could be in but with his questionable
consistency and drop in speed in the second and third spells, Prasidh Krishna
can't be ruled out either.
In this backdrop, facing an Australian team with Steve Smith and Marnus
Labuschagne back in form isn't an easy proposition.
""I haven't actually noticed as I am in my own bubble,"" Pat Cummins said when
asked about whether he noticed that in the rival camp, another out-of-form batter
Virat Kohli has been looking more proactive in the leadership role than the
regular skipper.
The Australian team will be handing a debut to all-rounder Beau Webster, who
would replace an off-colour Mitchell Marsh who hasn't scored much runs
throughout the series.
""There is one change with Beau Webster coming in place of Mitch Marsh. Mitch
knows that he hasn't scored enough runs,"" the home skipper informed.
Cummins will also have Mitchell Starc for company as he has been cleared after
back scans.
The pitch, according to Cummins, is seamer-friendly. He said the fast bowlers are
""happy with the surface"".
Despite the challenging build-up, Gambhir said he is ""extremely condent"" of
retaining the Border Gavaskar Trophy. The players will hope to be as condent as
they prepare for the ght to keep their World Test Final chances alive.

Times of India,2024-09-06 00:00:00, SBI chairman calls out a major 'tech challenge' that banks are facing,"State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman CS Setty has warned of growing cybersecurity challenges and the need for improved digital literacy in the banking sector. While investments in cybersecurity are on the rise, the availability of professional support for these activities remains limited, posing a significant hurdle for banks as they roll out digital systems.

Speaking at FIBAC 2024, a banking summit organized by the Indian Banks’ Association and FICCI, Setty emphasized the importance of addressing these challenges to ensure the successful transition to digital technologies and protect systems from cyber threats.
SBI has been able to create resilience in its systems while maintaining a positive customer experience, despite the complexities of integrating legacy systems with newer technologies. The bank has collaborated with fintech players and software solution providers to reimagine customer journeys and streamline processes.

Setty also discussed the need for banks to prioritize spending on technology that delivers tangible benefits, such as meeting regulatory requirements, acquiring new business, and enhancing customer experience. He cautioned against excessive spending on technology upgrades that do not contribute to overall transformation.

Investments in technology should focus on creating end-to-end experiences and processes that lead to operational efficiency. Additionally, banks should assess whether their digital interfaces are capable of handling large transaction volumes and consider redeploying staff to areas where they can contribute to business growth.

By addressing these challenges and making strategic investments in technology, banks can effectively navigate the digital landscape and ensure the security and efficiency of their operations.","State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman CS Setty, speaking at FIBAC 2024, highlighted growing cybersecurity challenges and the need for improved digital literacy in banking.

Even as the Hema committee report on issues in the Malayalam film industry, including those faced by women, have highlighted serious labour-related issues, these have not got much attention. The typical working hours of 15 hours or more, which technicians have confirmed to The Hindu, are violative of the labour laws.

The industry maintains long working hours to cut down on production costs. Newcomers, who rarely question such practices lest they lose job opportunities, slowly get used to it, perpetuating the system.

“The producers get all the profits, while the workers down the order end up with health issues due to irregular sleep and eating habits,” says a lighting crew member.

“There is no written contract in most departments. A sum is promised when they call us for a project. But after the shooting, production executives bargain to reduce this amount. In some projects, it is a struggle to get even that amount,” says a still photographer.

The extended working hours also create an entry barrier for women in many of these departments.

Labour Minister V. Sivankutty said the department has not yet received any complaint regarding the working conditions in the industry. “Only the technicians in the film industry come under the purview of the Labour department. If there is something in which the department can intervene, we will do that,” he said.","A lighting technician in the Malayalam film industry, Michael (name changed), describes his typical workday starting at 5 a.m. and often extending to 2 a.m., leaving little time for rest.

The Hindu,2024-11-01 00:00:00,Joseph hand-chopping case: NIA nabs first accused 13 years after incident,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested Savad, the first accused in the sensational T.J. Joseph hand-chopping case, 13 years after the gruesome incident.

Savad was arrested from a rented house at Beram ward in Mattannur municipality in Kannur district on Tuesday.

He had been doing carpentry works during his five-month stay in the area. He was produced before the NIA Special Court in Kochi on Wednesday afternoon.

Mini S. Das, Special Judge, remanded him to judicial custody till January 24.

The NIA had announced a reward of ₹10 lakh for information on Savad last year.

A native of Asamannoor in Ernakulam district, the 38-year-old had allegedly chopped off the right hand of T.J. Joseph, then Professor of Newman College at Thodupuzha in Idukki district. The attack was carried out by a group of activists of the now-banned Popular Front of India (PFI) while he was returning home with his family after attending the Sunday Mass at a church at Muvattupuzha in Ernakulam district on July 4, 2010.

According to the investigation agency, it was a reference to Prophet Mohammad in one of the question papers for BCom examinations in March 2010 set by Prof. Joseph that provoked the accused to attack the Professor.

Of the 42 accused, 19 were found guilty of various offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

According to the remand report, Savad had played a very important role in the planning and execution of the attack. Savad was one of the assailants who chopped the right palm of Prof. Joseph on the instructions of the PFI. Outraged by the alleged blasphemy committed by Prof. Joseph, Savad conducted recce of the victim’s house on previous occasions. He and six other accused attacked Prof. Joseph as part of a conspiracy and as instructed by principal conspirator M. K. Nasar.

A victory: Joseph

Reacting to the development, Prof. Joseph said that he considered the arrest “a victory for the legal system.”

“As a victim, I do not feel elated as the actual abettors of the crime continued to remain elusive,” he said.","The **National Investigation Agency (NIA)** arrested Savad, the prime accused in the T.J. Joseph hand-chopping case, 13 years after the incident. He was apprehended from a rented house in Mattannur, Kannur, and remanded to judicial custody. The attack, carried out by **Popular Front of India (PFI) activists** in 2010, was allegedly in response to a blasphemous reference in a college exam set by Prof. Joseph. Of 42 accused, 19 were convicted under UAPA. Joseph called the arrest a legal victory but noted that the main conspirators remain elusive.

The policy aims at “efforts towards strengthening institutional capacity to embed lifelong learning in the education and skills ecosystem”.

Further, the survey showed that the rise in enrolment in higher education has been driven by underprivileged sections such as SC, ST, and OBC, with a faster growth in female enrolment across sections.

“Female enrolment in higher education increased to 2.07 crore in FY22 from 1.57 crore in FY15, that is., a 31.6 per cent increase since FY15. The growing equity in higher education implies better employment opportunities for the hitherto backward sections,” it added.

The ICC has issued a stern warning to USAC, highlighting two primary areas of concern that could lead to the organisation being ""put on notice"", says a report. Also Read - West Indies not harnessing present talent, Test cricket issues can’t be solved with money: Lara ADVERTISEMENT The USA, co-hosting with the West Indies, staged the T20 World Cup in June across three venues, marking a milestone in the ICC’s ambition to break into the North American market. However, the warning underscores the challenges inherent in this ambition. The first issue pertains to USAC’s failure to meet the governance norms set by the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC). Achieving National Governing Body (NGB) status is mandatory for sports newly added to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, according to a report in ESPNcricinfo. Also Read - Jay Shah meets NBA Deputy Commissioner to share knowledge ADVERTISEMENT The second issue highlights USAC's inadequate administrative structure, notably its failure to appoint a permanent CEO after dismissing the previous incumbent. ""USA Cricket is currently Non-compliant with ICC Associate Member Membership Criteria 2.2(b)(i) (governance structure) and 2.2 (b)(ii) (administrative and executive structure) and is at risk of being placed 'On Notice',"" stated the ICC in a note sent to all its members attending the global cricket body's AGM in Colombo on July 22, as quoted by ESPNcricnfo. Also Read - India to not travel to Pakistan for ICC Champions Trophy 2025; to propose a hybrid model ADVERTISEMENT The ICC has expressed broader concerns regarding USAC's governance model, echoing sentiments from the USOPC. The USOPC has warned that failure to achieve NGB certification could lead to recognizing an alternate NGB for cricket, which would breach ICC Membership Criteria. This is the second warning this year. In March, the ICC alerted USAC about several issues, including its non-compliance with USOPC standards and the lack of a CEO. Despite these warnings, USAC has struggled to address these concerns adequately. The ICC board had considered suspending USAC's membership in March due to serious breaches but ultimately decided against it to avoid disrupting preparations for the 2024 T20 World Cup. Instead, the ICC provided USAC a ""last chance"" to remedy the non-compliance issues. Also Read - T20 World Cup: ICC, CWI release extra tickets for final match As a punitive measure, the ICC suspended USAC’s annual funding, offering only ""controlled funding"" on an ""exceptional basis"" between April and July to ensure cricket in the USA was not prejudiced. During the T20 World Cup, ICC chair Greg Barclay and CEO Geoff Allardice reiterated the risk of suspension if USAC failed to comply with membership criteria. In the latest AGM note, the ICC observed that USAC still lacks a ""fit-for-purpose administrative structure."" The organisation has yet to appoint a new CEO, despite initiating a recruitment process, and has not filled key development roles. The ICC management views USAC's efforts as insufficient and recommends stronger sanctions. In response, USAC informed the ICC that it had appointed Pintoo Shah as an independent director and Treasurer. USAC explained that delays were due to constitutional amendments required to align with USOPC regulations. USAC also argued that ICC’s threat of ""drastic action"" was unfair, given the organisation's efforts to comply, and noted that the USOPC accreditation process was only communicated on January 24, making a March compliance deadline unrealistic. The deadline for compliance submission to the USOPC is September 30. USAC assured the ICC that it had shortlisted candidates for the CEO position and planned to make the appointment immediately after the ICC AGM.
","USA Cricket (USAC) faces ICC scrutiny over potential non-compliance with Associate membership criteria, just a month after co-hosting the T20 World Cup. The ICC warned USAC for failing to meet US Olympic Committee governance standards and lacking a CEO.

In October 2023, Axis Bank floated the Achievers' Club contest in its rural business vertical to reward performance in various categories. It said top performers would be rewarded for raising high-value current accounts, forex income or term deposits and meeting loan disbursement targets. Winners were to be felicitated at various domestic and foreign locations.

In a communication sent to the private bank, the RBI said the rewards ""were in direct contravention of extant guidelines"" and that staff were given incentives over and above their variable pay. Mint has seen a copy of the Axis Bank contest announcement as well as relevant portions of the regulator's observations.

“We are proposing a contest to build momentum, particularly in Q2 and Q3 — which is (the) most challenging period of the year — for the overall business and to motivate the sales team to deliver superlative performance during (the) contest period,"" an Axis Bank internal note said in October. The contest was open for the wholesale and retail units of Bharat Enterprises, a part of Axis Bank's unit which serves rural customers.

Citing an analysis, Axis Bank said that in one of the contests where 103 employees could have become eligible for rewards, the cost would be ₹75 lakh, while it was expected to earn incremental revenue and fees of ₹4.86 crore for the bank. Similarly, in another contest, the bank concluded that by spending ₹15.75 lakh on 25 eligible employees, it could earn ₹2.7 crore in revenue and fees.

No incentives allowed

However, RBI guidelines forbid lenders from offering incentives for raising deposits. According to its 2016 directions on deposit rates, banks cannot “offer prize/lottery/free trips (in India and/or abroad), etc or any other initiative having (an) element of chance for mobilizing deposits"". But they are free to give inexpensive gifts of not more than ₹250, at their discretion, to depositors at the time of accepting deposits.

“Scheduled commercial banks shall not pay any remuneration or fees or commission or brokerage or incentives on deposits in any form or manner to any individual, firm, company, association, institution or any other person except (in certain cases),"" as per RBI regulations.

These exceptions include commission paid to agents employed to collect door-to-door deposits under a special scheme; those paid to direct selling agents or direct marketing agents as part of the outsourcing arrangements; and remuneration paid to business facilitators or business correspondents.

A senior banker who has served on the boards of several lenders likened the practice to how insurance companies once used to market their products to bank customers through bancassurance tie-ups, adding such internal contests are not very common at banks nowadays.

Emails sent to RBI and Axis Bank remained unanswered.

Compensation off purview

According to two central bankers, one of whom is retired, the regulator does not interfere in bank employees' compensation, and there are no specific guidelines around targets and what incentives banks pay on achieving them.

“Staff compensation is left to the bank’s board. However, RBI could point out its displeasure in cases where such incentives could lead to mis-selling,"" the former RBI official said. Since these guidelines also mention depositors as being incentivized, banks might have interpreted it as not being applicable to employees, the former official said on the condition of anonymity.

The regulator has now given Axis Bank an opportunity to respond to its observations and explain the rationale for the contest. There have been cases where the RBI has accepted the reasoning provided by regulated entities and withdrew its observations, the former RBI official said.

Mis-selling worries

Experts said RBI's intervention raises the question of whether the regulator is concerned about the potential for mis-selling or the structure of the rewards itself.

“While RBI typically does not interfere in staff salaries or incentive schemes, this move suggests that the regulator may be looking into whether such rewards encourage aggressive sales tactics, leading to mis-selling of financial products like CASA,"" said Suma R.V., partner, King Stubb & Kasiva, a law firm. “The nature of foreign and local trips as incentives could push employees to prioritize short-term sales goals over long-term customer interests, something the RBI seems keen to avoid.""

The Morung Express,2024-12-06 00:00:00,India in advantageous position for relations with Trump 2.0 term: EAM Jaishankar,"India is in a 'much more advantageous position' than many other countries in the world to build 'deeper' relations with the incoming Donald Trump 2.0 administration in the US, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar said on Thursday.

Speaking at an ASSOCHAM conference on ‘Viksit Bharat Summit’ in the national capital, EAM Jaishankar said the way important economies look at India has undergone a tremendous change in the last 10 years.

Asked about the prospects of India-US relations under Trump 2.0 , the minister said, ''there are countries which are looking at Trump 2.0 as a political challenge; we are not. That separates us from a very large number of countries, so we are in a much more advantageous position to translate 2.0 into a deeper relationship’”.

He said India would also have to work out a political equation with America under Trump.

""That is one area where we score because we have always had positive political relations with Trump and he always had a positive view of India,” said Jaishankar.

“However, it would not automatically translate into every transaction. Like everybody else we may also have some issues; we will deal with those issues’,” he added.

Dr Jaishankar said the US would need India in many areas where they would like to take technology leads. The two countries would have to build an understanding of mutual benefits and relationships in several areas like emerging and critical technologies as trusted partners.

The External Affairs Minister said that India would not want to end up as a market for another economy and not being able to compete with their products which are dumped in our country.

Dr Jaishankar also touched upon relations with Russia and the geo-political situation in the Middle East. He particularly talked about the shipping challenges in the Red Sea and how the situation there is of direct consequences to India's economic interest.

Talking about the MSMEs and their role in manufacturing, the External Affairs Minister said It is one of the top priorities of the government. ''We have to create more manufacturing zones, improve logistics and make ourselves more competitive. I think we have made progress but there is a lot we will have to do,” he added.","India is well-positioned to strengthen ties with the incoming Donald Trump 2.0 administration, according to External Affairs Minister Dr. S.

It has been three years since Ashwin last played a Test here, and there is no certainty when another would come by. “My leave application is ready. Whenever Bangladesh bats, I would just send it to my office and take my seat at Chepauk,” says Bhuvanesh, who is one among the 13 RUCA (Ramakrishnapuram Underarm Cricketers Association) members that includes Ashwin.

As a Test match at Chepauk is around the corner a group of friends in Chennai who grew up in Ramakrishnapuram 1st street in West Mambalam can’t stop themselves from going on a nostalgic ride. For a good part of their growing up years, this street meant everything just like for youngsters growing up anywhere in India. It is the place from where one of their own made it to the highest level.

“In our whole gang, there used to be only one guy who spoke of his dream to play for India. He was so passionate…” Sai Kumar, who is also part of RUCA group begins before adding the punch-line. “And it wasn’t Ashwin, but another friend called “Raju”. Despite having all the talent in the world, Ashwin always kept it to himself. To be honest, we never knew Ashwin had such thoughts. For me, he was a guy who used to wear this manjal sokka (yellow shirt) and be one among us.”

The Ramakrishnapuram 1st street still means the world to them, even though there are no traces of what it used to be when it was literally their home. Now, on a busy evening, cars driving through the congested street jostle with pedestrians. School children, middle-aged people, elderly all take leisurely walks.

A decade back, the same street used to witness under-arm cricket tournaments and matches that went long into the night courtesy focus lamps installed by Ashwin’s household. “Ashwin had a separate net facility close to his home. It was a small strip, made exclusively for him to bat. But we had some 7-8 of us, so the street became our ground. Especially on weekends, we used to own the streets along with Subash Chandran, and Vignesh amongst us. It was the time pub culture was setting in Chennai and while most guys from our age group would be partying on Saturday, we would be here playing cricket,” Bhuvanesh says.

Bhuvanesh also recalls an important decision he had to take to keep the sanity in the group. “I decided to be in the same team as Ashwin because I wanted to avoid picking fights with him. If we were in opposite teams, we would keep fighting like in the case of Mankanding. And we would pause the game for a while.”

It is perhaps fitting that Ashwin titles his book which released recently as “I have the streets: A Kutti Story”. It was at Ramakrishnapuram 1st street where Ashwin would fall in love with the game. It had become so tangled with his life that despite his coaches warning him to not play tennis ball cricket as it would affect his prospects of playing professional cricket, Ashwin would continue to play in the evenings. “It wasn’t some timepass cricket we are talking about. Ashwin being Ashwin, he used to make it so competitive that it brought the best in all of us. The bet matches especially used to witness all sorts of fights that you see in gully cricket, especially with run-outs, no-balls and waist-high full-tosses. Whoever lost had to pay or else Ashwin won’t include them for the next game. That 10 rupee wasn’t going to change our lives, but with him it was all about the spirit,” Sai says.

Not overtly ambitious

Though Ashwin had been a regular in age-group and an established name in the domestic circuit when he was 18-19, Sai and Bhuvanesh don’t recall the facet of their friend who has owned a spot for himself among the spin bowling greats.

“He never came across like one who aspired to big things. He never showed it. He was just hiding it all the time. When you get close to someone, you will get to know their aspirations. But with Ashwin, we never got to see that at all. It is just down to his roots I guess,” Bhuvanesh says.

As the years have gone by, most of them have left Ramakrishnapuram 1st street with Ashwin being the lone left now. Even their annual meetings that used to happen soon after the IPL haven’t happened since 2015. “Once the IPL gets over, we used to plan short trips or stays. We went to Kodaikanal, Pondicherry, ECR and Goa, but since then we haven’t been together. Some of us have moved abroad. But we have to meet soon because this group is special,” Sai says.

For a good part of their growing up years, this street meant everything just like for youngsters growing up anywhere in India. It is the place from where one of their own made it to the highest level. (Special Arrangement) For a good part of their growing up years, this street meant everything just like for youngsters growing up anywhere in India.

Bhuvanesh says why. “We didn’t study in the same school or college. We didn’t work together. But we became friends because we played cricket. Even now it is the same. Sometimes Sai will even tell Ashwin ‘You may have taken the best batsman, but you won’t be able to dismiss me at Ramakrishnapuram and Ashwin would struggle to contain himself. It is just a bunch of normal friends.”

With Tuesday being Ashwin’s birthday, his friends had planned a surprise. One of them called Venkat even flew in from Australia to wish him.

In a letter to Atishi, Chouhan said the AAP government has failed to implement major central initiatives including the Integrated Horticulture Development Mission, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, and the Beej Gram programme.

""I am writing this letter in sadness. You have never taken proper decisions in the interest of farmers. Your government has stopped implementation of farmers-friendly central schemes. Your government is not sympathetic towards farmers. Today, farmers in Delhi are upset and worried,"" Chouhan said in the letter dated January 1.Due to the non-implementation of multiple central schemes, Delhi's farmers are being denied crucial benefits ranging from seed distribution to infrastructure development, he said.

The Union minister said the absence of the Integrated Horticulture Development Mission has prevented farmers from accessing benefits for nursery establishment, tissue culture facilities, planting material procurement, and post-harvest infrastructure.

The non-implementation of Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana has further impacted farmers' access to agricultural mechanization, precision irrigation, soil health initiatives, crop insurance, and the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana, he added.

Chouhan expressed concern over Delhi's failure to implement the Beej Gram programme, which offers benefits including seed distribution, testing facilities, laboratory infrastructure improvement, and assistance for seed certification agencies.","**Agriculture Minister Criticizes Delhi Government Over Farmer Welfare Schemes**

Mint,2024-07-01 00:00:00,AP Moller leads race for Pristine Logistics,"Infrastructure fund manager A.P. Moller Capital has emerged as the front runner for BlackRock-owned Global Infrastructure Partners’ 57% stake in Pristine Logistics & Infraprojects Ltd, two people aware of the development said.

The transaction, which involves a primary equity raise and secondary sale, may see an enterprise value of around $500 million, the people cited above said on the condition of anonymity.

Among others competing for the stake in the Delhi-based company are US freight rail company Midrail LLC, and a joint venture of European alternative asset manager EQT and Singapore’s state investment firm Temasek Holdings Pte. EQT and Temasek already jointly operate O2 Power, an Indian renewable energy platform they launched in 2020.

“APM Capital, EQT and Temasek and MidRail are in the fray for acquiring the stake. APM Capital is leading the process,” said one of the two people mentioned above.

New York-based GIP, which was acquired by the asset management major Blackrock Inc. in January this year for about $12.5 billion, is looking to exit its investment in Pristine Logistics. It holds about 57% through the Indian Infrastructure Fund II, which it manages after its acquisition of IDFC Alternative Fund in 2022. Prior to the acquisition, IDFC Alternatives had raised two infrastructure funds—India Infrastructure Fund and India Infrastructure Fund II.

ET Infra had earlier reported that A.P. Moller Capital P/S, part of the A.P. Moller Group, is said to be among entities seeking to buy GIP’s Pristine Logistics stake.

Queries sent to Pristine Logistics, AP Moller Capital, MidRail, and EQT remained unanswered till press time. A Temasek spokesperson said: “As a matter of policy, we do not comment on behalf of our portfolio companies, including our JVs.”

Pristine Logistics, which is in the rail-focused logistics business, was founded in 2008 by former Indian Railways officials Amit Kumar and Rajnish Kumar. The company operates five logistics parks through its subsidiaries, in Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), Ludhiana (Punjab), Siliguri (West Bengal), Patna (Bihar) and Birgunj (Nepal). The company website says Pristine owns 900,000 sq. ft of warehousing and about 2,624 domestic standard containers and 395 dwarf containers. It also operates around 390 trailers and 37 rakes.

Last year, Pristine acquired debt-ridden Sical Logistics for about ₹400 crore through the National Company law Tribunal. In November, it also acquired Distribution Logistics Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd and its group companies (DLI India) from the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) London-listed Infrastructure India Plc in a stock and cash deal.

In 2022, the company had filed for an initial public offering (IPO) to raise about ₹250 crore, and Sebi had approved the IPO in October that year. The company, however, did not go ahead with a listing. Its prospectus showed that IIF-II, the fund currently managed by GIP, holds about 30.86 million shares or about 57% of the stake. Through the IPO, GIP was to sell 17.77 million shares.

Pristine had planned to use the IPO proceeds to invest in its subsidiaries for repayment or pre-payment, in full or part, of certain borrowings availed by its subsidiaries, apart from general corporate purposes.

A. P. Moller, meanwhile, is focused on investments in critical transport and logistics infrastructure along with energy, including renewables.

“We focus on investments that support sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the markets where we operate while delivering consistent and competitive returns,” says the company website.

In May this year, the fund manager signed a memorandum of understanding with JSW Infrastructure Ltd to create a joint venture and develop ports and logistics infrastructure in India.

India’s logistics space seems to garner investor interest amid policy push from the government, including infrastructure status for the segment and the rollout of the National Logistics Policy. As per India Investment Grid, a platform under the Union commerce ministry, India has investment opportunities worth nearly $11 billion in logistics infrastructure.","A.P.

The company, which had planned an IPO in 2022, is now attracting significant investor interest. A.P.

The Morung Express,2024-10-21 00:00:00,"With eye on China, PM Modi says India does not build relations on ‘taken-for-granted’ basis","Highlighting that trust and reliability are the foundations of India’s relations with the global community, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that India does not build relations on a “taken-for-granted” basis.

“Our progress brings joy to the world and not jealousy,” said PM Modi, in a veiled message to China which is often criticised for its perceived expansionist policies and predatory lending.

Delivering the keynote address at the two-day 'NDTV World Summit 2024 - The India Century' event, he said that there is a growing realisation that India is a country whose growth brings about celebrations across the globe.

The international reception received by the successful Chandrayan Mission was one such example, he said.

Describing the concept of global economy as a gift of India, PM Modi said, “India does not build relations on ‘taken-for-granted basis’. Our relations are based on trust and reliability and even the world is realising this.”

Recalling the Covid crisis, he said, “We could have earned crores of dollars by using our capacity to produce vaccines, it would have been beneficial for India but a setback for humanity. But our values did not allow us to do this and we helped several nations during the crisis.”

The world has started believing that India is a reliable partner during calamity, he said.

“The all-round changes taking place in the country are also increasing the global community’s trust in India which is taking a lead in giving a direction to the global future on a number of issues,” he said.

Showcasing the model of ‘Jan Shakti se Rashtra Nirman’ (nation building with public participation), PM Modi said that the country was moving ahead at an unprecedented speed as the targets for the next 25 years have been set on the basis of public debate.

“Double AI advantage is another factor that is making the next century the India Century. The double advantage is that of Artificial Intelligence and Aspirational India,” the PM said.

“Our policies are formed keeping aspirational India in mind,” he said, citing the UDAN scheme that has helped the common man fly and bring about a connectivity revolution.

He said that the government was committed to forming policies aimed at ease of living, quality of life improvement and welfare of the youth and women.","Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the 'NDTV World Summit 2024 - The India Century' event, emphasized that India’s global relations are built on trust and reliability, not on a ""taken-for-granted"" basis.

Modi highlighted India’s values, citing the country's support during the Covid crisis, and its growing global trust.

The Statesman,2024-07-30 00:00:00,Divisive Alliances,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s recent speech to the US Congress underscored the deepening complexities and divisions surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Mr Netanyahu aimed to solidify US support for Israel’s war against Hamas by framing the conflict as part of a larger struggle against Iran, a common enemy of both nations. His message received a warm reception from many Republican lawmakers but faced significant criticism from Democrats and widespread protests.

Mr Netanyahu’s portrayal of the conflict as a fight against a shared enemy was a strategic move to align US and Israeli interests. By emphasising that “our enemies are your enemies,” he sought to reinforce the notion that Israel’s security challenges are intrinsically linked to those of the United States. This perspective resonated with many Republicans but highlighted a stark partisan divide, as evidenced by the absence of numerous Democratic lawmakers and the pointed criticism from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The protests that accompanied Mr Netanyahu’s visit, both inside and outside the Capitol, underscored the contentious nature of his stance.


Demonstrators reflected a significant portion of public opinion deeply concerned about the humanitarian impact of the ongoing conflict, which has resulted in over 39,000 deaths according to Hamas-run health authorities. Mr Netanyahu’s response to these concerns was largely dismissive, attributing the suffering in Gaza to Hamas. This dismissal fails to acknowledge the broader humanitarian crisis and risks alienating those advocating for a more balanced and humane approach to the conflict. His vision for a demilitarised Gaza under Israeli control, without any reference to a two-state solution, underscores a lack of commitment to a negotiated peace that considers the rights and aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians. Amid these events, Mr Netanyahu’s meetings with US leaders added further layers of complexity.



His discussions with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris highlighted the delicate balance of US-Israel relations. Ms Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for President, has been vocal about the need to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, stating that she “will not be silent” about the suffering of Palestinian civilians. Mr Netanyahu’s reaction to Ms Harris’s statement was cautious, emphasising that US-Israel unity is crucial for expediting a ceasefire deal, while expressing concern that her comments might complicate negotiations. Mr Netanyahu’s subsequent visit to former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate further underscored the geopolitical dynamics at play. Mr Trump, who has pledged to seek peace if re-elected, criticised Ms Harris’s comments as “disrespectful” to Israel.


This visit, and Mr Trump’s past policies such as moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognising Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, highlight the shifting landscape of US policy towards Israel and its implications for West Asia. The announcement that Israel will participate in ceasefire talks in Rome offers a glimmer of hope. These negotiations, involving key regional players and the head of America’s Central Intelligence Agency, are crucial for ending hostilities and securing the release of hostages.","Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent address to the US Congress highlighted the complex dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. By framing the conflict as part of a broader struggle against Iran, Netanyahu aimed to strengthen US support for Israel's actions against Hamas. This approach resonated with many Republicans but faced criticism from Democrats, reflecting a deep partisan divide.

Protests during Netanyahu’s visit underscored public concern over the humanitarian impact of the conflict, which has resulted in significant casualties. Netanyahu’s dismissal of these concerns, coupled with his vision of a demilitarized Gaza without a two-state solution, has drawn criticism for lacking a balanced approach to peace.

Meetings with US leaders, including President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, revealed the delicate balance of US-Israel relations. Harris has called for addressing the humanitarian crisis, while Netanyahu has emphasized the importance of US-Israel unity for a ceasefire.

mint,2024-10-16 00:00:00,Karnataka: MUDA chief K Marigowda resigns citing health issues amid land allotment row involving CM Siddaramaiah,"Mysore Urban Development Authority (MUDA) chairman K Marigowda on Wednesday resigned from the post amid a row involving Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, his wife and other family members, NDTV reported.MUDA chief Marigowda, who is considered a close confidant of Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, cited health reasons while resigning from the post.""I have given my resignation to the Secretary of the Urban Development Department, the CM instructed me to resign, so I have resigned. My health is not good, so I resigned. MUDA investigation is ongoing. Let the investigation take place. The investigation will reveal the truth. There is no pressure on me. I resigned due to ill health. The CM has not put any pressure on me regarding the issue,"" TOI quoted Marigowda’s resignation letter.In the recent past, Marigowda has faced much criticism and several of his critics blame him for the current crisis faced by the Karnataka chief minister in connection with the MUDA site allotment case.

The resignation comes amid the alleged land scam involving Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, his wife and other family members. MUDA chief, along with chief minister Siddaramaiah, were at the center of the controversy in the alleged mishandling of compensatory sites by MUDA. The case revolves around a 3.2-acre parcel of land gifted to Siddaramaiah's wife, Parvathi, by her brother Mallikarjunaswamy in 2010.

Soon after the MUDA chairman resigned from his post, the BJP demanded that CM Siddaramaiah should also resign immediately stressing that he is ""deeply embroiled"" in the alleged land ""scam"".BJP national spokesperson and MP Sambit Patra said at a press conference, “MUDA chairman has tendered his resignation... I call upon Siddaramaiah that if you have the slightest morality left in you, you should step down immediately. You should not wait for today's sunset.”

It is important to note that Marigowda has worked with Chief Minister Siddaramaiah since 1983. He worked as President of the Mysuru Taluk Panchayat in 1995, Vice President of the Zilla Panchayat in 2000, and was later promoted to the top post eight years later.

Joining families of jailed activists, including former JNU scholar Umar Khalid, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday said bail is rarely granted when the affected party is Muslim. During a panel discussion organised by the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR) to mark four years since the arrest of activists from the anti-CAA-NRC protests, Digvijaya Singh criticised the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He compared the RSS's alleged targeting of Muslims in India to the persecution of Jews during Hitler’s regime in Germany. Dig Deeper

the morung express,2024-07-19 00:00:00,Nagaland: ‘Other zoonotic diseases could soon cause another pandemic’,"An awareness event on zoonotic diseases for staff under the Chief Medical Officer's Office Dimapur was held at the CMO’s conference hall in Dimapur on July 19.

Dr Michael Imchen, Assistant Surgeon, Department of Animal Husbandry & Veterinary Dimapur delivered a comprehensive presentation on zoonotic diseases, their transmissions, and preventive measures. Zoonotic diseases are infections transmitted between animals and humans. These infections are caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and other pathogens, stated a press release from IEC Bureau Section, office of the CMO Dimapur. 


Dr Kavito Zhimmomi chairing the programme.
Dr Imchen stated that the main factors leading to the increase in transmission of zoonotic diseases are deforestation, illegal and poorly regulated wildlife trade, climate change, intensified agriculture and livestock production, and antimicrobial resistance. 

He emphasised that the best measures to prevent and control the spread of zoonotic infections are to stop deforestation, halt wildlife trade and consumption, and maintain personal hygiene and sanitation. He also cautioned, “Unless we start to conserve nature and care for our environment, other zoonotic diseases like the coronavirus could soon cause another pandemic, and it might not be long before we start fighting for natural resources like clean water.”

To the pet owners, Dr Imchen urged them to vaccinate their pets, keep them clean, and always practice hand washing after petting or playing with them. He cautioned those who rear pigs, poultry, or any livestock in their residences to maintain regular cleaning of livestock habitats and ensure that their animals are vaccinated to prevent transmissions. He further advised deworming of not only pets and livestock but also recommended that people should take deworming medication annually to prevent infections.


Dr Mulong.
Dr Mulong Jamir, Epidemiologist, IDSP Dimapur, presented a brief history of zoonotic diseases. He stated that there are over 1,400 zoonotic pathogens, and over 60% of them can cause infections in humans. He explained that the main mode of transmission is through direct contact with animals. Awareness, vaccinations, personal hygiene and sanitation, and early detection are ways to prevent and control the spread of zoonotic diseases. He also stressed the importance of distinguishing between zoonotic and non-zoonotic diseases to eliminate unnecessary fear.

The programme was chaired by Dr Kavito Zhimmomi, DPO CD-I and DSO Dimapur. In his closing remarks, he urged the participants to learn from the past COVID-19 pandemic and to habituate the practice of handwashing and personal hygiene to prevent the spread of any infection.","On July 19, an awareness event on zoonotic diseases was held at the Chief Medical Officer’s conference hall in Dimapur.

The New Indian Express,2024-10-05 00:00:00,INTERVIEW | 'Whoever silenced the Hema Committee report in 2019 is the villain',"In light of the Hema Committee report, The New Indian Express spoke to filmmaker and editor of The Daily Eye, Vinta Nanda, to reflect on the Me-Too movement in Bollywood in 2018 and its impact on the women who came forward to speak against predators.

Nanda had accused Alok Nath, an actor in her TV series Tara, of raping her in the late-1990s. Nath was subsequently expelled from the Cine and TV Artists Association (CINTAA). Excerpts from the interview:

When it comes to what is panning out in Kerala now and what happened back in 2018 in Mumbai, what are the differences? Are solidarity and WCC key to the Hema Committee formulation and findings?

Me-Too in Bollywood is now viewed as individual battles, but at the time, it was a collective movement. Many women came forward, but now, except for me, maybe a couple of others like Tanushree Datta, and of course a section of the media which continues to follow up on it, no one talks about it anymore. I'm older and know my career options. I don't mind being isolated for speaking up, but I understand why younger women have gone silent — they have their whole lives and careers ahead of them. I might have done the same in their position. I'm bolder now, simply because of my age.

There was solidarity among the women who spoke out. Although some doors closed for many of us, others opened. Filmmakers, NGOs, activists, and Mathew Antony, along with his stellar team of lawyers, Dhruti Kapadia, Faranaz Karbhari and Kunal Tiwari, offered pro bono help. They stood by me and so also did others for the many women who spoke courageously. But over time, unfortunately, we became scattered. One of the leading associations for Directors of films and television, worked to silence us. During a meeting where I was asked to recount my experience, the hostility was overwhelming. I was emotionally crushed and broke down in front of industry leaders. It was humiliating. I later recovered, but it was one of the hardest moments.

The younger women, many of whom spoke out against powerful film directors, faced similar circumstances and immense challenges. Approaching people for work after that was impossible. I had more agency because of an established career. If I struggled, imagine what it must have been like for them. We still support each other, but there's little we can do.

The Hema Committee members handing over the report to CM Pinarayi Vijayan in 2019.
Hidden cameras in caravan; explicit sexual abuse: Veteran actors recount harrowing experiences in Malayalam cinema
Is that the reason why there's silence now on the Hema Committee report?

What really bothers me is that the Hema Committee report was to be released in 2019, following the 2018 Me-Too movement. Imagine the momentum it could have built. Instead, but it was buried. It would have placed the Me-Too movement in a much stronger position. The report could have changed everything for women in the industry. Now, we feel cheated — those of us who spoke out in 2018. Whoever silenced that report in 2019 is the villain.

People are now screened before they're allowed into Bollywood's inner circles. Anyone likely to rebel or speak up isn't allowed in. The movement is being laughed at, and the women who came forward are ridiculed. It's a sad situation.

You spoke about IFTDA and CINTAA. What was the role of the various associations in Bollywood?

The Screenwriters Association (SWA) reached out to me quickly. The Producers' Guild of India sent a polite note of sympathy, but nothing more. SWA was more engaged — they formed a committee to listen to me. They were sensitive but stepped back, saying they couldn't go any further to hearing me out due to jurisdictional limitations. I was pressured into filing an FIR, even though I knew it wouldn't lead anywhere. It felt pointless — 20 years later, what proof could I offer? The idea of a medical examination was especially absurd.

CINTAA, however, took action. Though I wasn't a member, they pursued my case because the accused was. They sent him notices, and when he didn't appear, they suspended him. That was concrete action.

Unfortunately, the new CINTAA committee doesn't prioritise women's issues like the previous one did. They're no longer in office but regularly in touch with me as well as the others.

What can be the way forward to set things right?

We need to start with the basics — pay parity. Why can't women be paid equally? The common excuse is that women's films don’t do well, but how much do you invest in marketing them? If you marketed a film with a female protagonist as aggressively as a male-led film, I'm certain she could carry it. It's a chicken-and-egg story.The marketing of a Shraddha Kapoor led film, for instance, isn't backed with the same budget as one of a lead hero unless she's starring alongside one. How will people know a woman-led film even exists if it isn't marketed and distributed in the manner that male-led films are?

Also, this is not just about actors. Women work in every department of this industry — sound engineers, DoPs, hairdressers, makeup artists, today we have women working as gaffers too — and they all deserve to be paid equally. This disparity affects every corner of the industry. Once women are paid equally, everything else will fall into place. If you pay me lesser than a man doing the same job as I am doing, you'll treat me as less.

In a television debate recently, there were speakers claiming that Me-Too only affected only ""low-hanging fruit"". But that's where the worst violations occur — where the public isn't looking.

Actors make up only 10% of the women working in this industry. The other 90% are in the shadows, and the conditions they work in are often appalling. This is where the focus needs to be.

Hema Committee report: A battle fought well by a few
There were some young filmmakers back in 2018 who spoke of having bigger representation of women in their crews. Do you see that as having any consequence?

I don't think it's part of a strategic design. There are odd films here and there where women dominate the cast and crew but they are few and far between. Women's representation has grown over the years, but even today, productions are planned with the intent to hire more men than women. If women are included it's because they have to be — it's more optics than real change. The world is watching, so they have no choice but to include women on their sets, but it's not done willingly.

You made a film in 2023 called #Shout, which focused on patriarchy and the feminist movement in India. What happened to the film?

#Shout is about patriarchy and traces 50 years of the feminist movement in India, juxtaposed with the Me-Too movement. We travelled the country, starting 2019, interviewing 55 people from various walks of life — activists, lawyers, survivors, families of victims, authors, advocates of human rights and many from marginalised communities who face injustice. It took us four years to complete the film, and by the time it was finished, the producers got cold feet. They realised the film was honest, too truthful about the status of women and patriarchy in India. They had expected a sensationalised, commercial take on Me-Too. Instead, they got a meaningful documentary that would be taken seriously. Also, as an established production company they feared backlash from the industry which has been largely hostile towards survivors and sympathetic towards the men who were called out ever since the Me-Too movement.

Now, the film is stuck with the censors, and they won't pass it without cuts that would gut the entire message. Everyone's terrified of what might happen if the truth about patriarchy is told in this country.

","Filmmaker Vinta Nanda reflects on the Me-Too movement, noting a shift from collective solidarity in 2018 to isolation today. She emphasizes the need for equal pay and representation for women in Bollywood, arguing that financial parity is crucial for fostering respect. Nanda criticizes the industry's superficial inclusion of women and discusses the challenges her documentary, #Shout, faced with censors, highlighting ongoing resistance to addressing women's rights and systemic inequality.

The New Indian Express,2024-12-31 00:00:00,"Hasina’s ouster, Trump return, South Korea’s impeachment: Top 10 global events that made headlines in 2024","The year 2024 unfolded as a mosaic of human triumphs and challenges, marked by historic political shifts, unexpected tragedies, and escalating environmental crises. With each headline, came a picture of societal struggles, unresolved tensions, and the fragile balance of power.

As these events played out across our screens, they shaped conversations and opinions. As we usher in the new year 2025, here are the top ten issues that defined 2024 and are set to influence the year ahead.

Bangladesh students’ protest and Hasina ouster
In 2024, Bangladesh was plunged into chaos as anti-government protests forced Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign and flee to India. Weeks of deadly demonstrations, fuelled by anger over civil service job quotas, culminated in protesters storming Hasina’s residence.At least 91 people were killed in clashes on a single day, the highest toll in recent history. The military, led by General Waker-uz-Zaman, declared an interim government and pledged peace. Opposition leader Khaleda Zia and detained protesters were released while student leaders called for democratic reforms. The UN and the US urged restraint as the nation faced an uncertain future.

Trump back to White House
Donald Trump won the 2024 US presidential election, securing both the Electoral College with 312 votes and the popular vote — a rare feat for Republicans since 1988. He swept all seven battleground states, defeating Vice President Kamala Harris by a margin of 1.62%. However, his victory margins were historically narrow, with only 2.5 million more votes than Harris.Down-ballot Republicans saw limited gains, as Democrats retained key Senate seats and made inroads in some state legislatures. Experts described Trump’s win as significant but not an overwhelming endorsement of the Republican Party, suggesting potential challenges for the GOP in future elections.

Assad’s ouster
Syrian rebels, backed by Turkey, entered Damascus unopposed, overthrowing President Bashar al-Assad and ending over five decades of his family’s rule. Assad fled to Russia, where he was granted asylum. The fall of Assad’s regime marked a turning point in the Middle East, disrupting Iran and Russia’s regional influence and raising hopes for the return of millions of displaced Syrians.Celebrations erupted in Damascus, with freed prisoners and jubilant crowds taking to the streets. Rebel leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani declared a new era, while global leaders acknowledged the challenges ahead in rebuilding Syria after its devastating 13-year civil war.

South Korea impeachment
In December 2024, South Korea experienced a political crisis marked by the impeachment of two presidents in quick succession. The turmoil began on December 3 when President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law, prompting parliament to impeach him. Acting President Han Duck-soo then took over but was also impeached two weeks later.The National Assembly voted 192-0 to remove Han, with ruling party lawmakers boycotting the vote after the speaker reduced the threshold for impeachment. Han was accused of stalling Yoon’s impeachment trial by refusing to appoint judges. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok is now serving as acting president amid the instability.

France political bizarre
In 2024, France faced political upheaval after snap elections left the Assemblée Nationale split into three almost equal blocs —left, center, and far-right— without a clear majority. President Emmanuel Macron refused to appoint a prime minister from the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP), which won the most seats.Despite days of talks aimed at resolving the deadlock, Macron rejected the NFP’s candidate, warning that their government would face an immediate no-confidence vote. His decision provoked outrage from the left, with threats of impeachment. The political stalemate highlighted the challenges of governing a deeply polarised France.

Hezbollah’s ‘war of support’ – a catastrophe
The year 2024 was marked by new escalation of armed conflict across the Middle East, with Israel expanded operations into Lebanon to target Hezbollah, whose militants have fired hundreds of rockets into Israel in what it calls a “war of support” for Hamas.From, decade-long Mossad infiltration leading to remotely detonating explosives hidden in thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah in mid-September, a missile strike in July, that assassinated senior commander Fuad Shukr, to the killing of Hezbollah’s feared leader, Hassan Nasrallah, who for decades commanded a Lebanese militia in its fight against the Israeli state, as well as multiple withering aerial bombardment in the three main Shia strongholds: southern Lebanon, the eastern Bekaa Valley, and the southern suburbs of Beirut, with the aim of destroying thousands of missiles and rockets capable of hitting Israel, every day of year marked a catastrophic culmination for the group.

At the end, Hezbollah’s capitulation came in form of a US-brokered November ceasefire, which forced the group to retreat north of the Litani River, weakening their southern Lebanon operations and straining ties with Iran.Iran: President Raisi’s death, new entrant in war
In a shocking turn of events, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash on May 19, 2024. The crash occurred in Azerbaijan and claimed the lives of eight individuals, including Raisi’s foreign minister. While some Iranians celebrated his death due to his controversial presidency marked by repression and economic turmoil, it sparked immediate concerns about potential power struggles within the Iranian regime. However, reports suggest that Raisi’s death is unlikely to significantly alter Iran’s foreign policy or internal governance, as Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei maintains tight control over these areas.In parallel, tensions between Tel Aviv and Tehran escalated significantly, with both nations engaging in reciprocal strikes targeting each other’s military installations. While these strikes did not result in major casualties, they marked a sharp increase in hostilities. Israel intensified its military operations in Syria and Iraq, focusing on Iranian military infrastructure in those regions

The incidents has implications for Iran’s geopolitical stance amidst ongoing tensions with United States, particularly regarding its support for proxy groups like Hezbollah.

Russia-Ukraine: No endgame!
In 2024, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has become a war of attrition. Russia gained the upper hand after Ukraine’s 2023 counteroffensive faltered, capturing Avdiivka and opening a new front in Kharkiv. Despite ammunition shortages and slowed foreign aid, Ukraine launched a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region, gaining leverage in ceasefire talks. Both sides rely on external support, with Russia receiving drones from Iran and ammunition from North Korea, while Ukraine seeks long-range missiles and continued Western backing.Militarily, Russia’s vast manpower and superior equipment outweigh Ukraine’s defenses, but the risk of internal discontent limits further Russian mobilization. While, Russia has faced increasing pressure from Western nations through sanctions and military aid to Ukraine.

The war’s future increasingly hinges on US policy under a prospective Trump administration and its impact on negotiations.

Hamas’ likely demise: Haniyeh, Sinwar death
The man dubbed by Israel a “dead man walking” is dead in 2024.

As calendars in 2024, marked a year of deadliest terror attack in the Israel’s history, Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the man believed to be the mastermind of the October 7 attack in 2023 was killed in October 2024, following a year-long manhunt — a year of pounding by Tel Aviv, which has left swathes of Gaza flattened, killed more than 42,000 people, and left Hamas greatly weakened.However, this wasn’t the only blow Hamas experienced this year, the series started with killing of Ismail Haniyeh, the former head of the political bureau, in an Israeli assassination operation at the end of July in the heart of Tehran. Reports indicate that he was killed by an explosive device planted in his guesthouse in Tehran attending the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.

While, the reports highlighted the leadership of the Palestinian armed group has been left in “a state of shock” by the assassination of its two  biggest political leader, the group still stress that the Resistance will continue and will follow in the path.

Pakistan: Air pollution top charts
While, air pollution can be story of every year for the south-east Asia now, Pakistan in 2024, experienced some of the worst air quality in November. In November, Lahore recorded an average Air Quality Index (AQI) over deadly mark of 2,000 making it the most polluted city in the world.However, amid worsening air quality in Lahore, Pakistani minister Marriyum Aurangzeb cited winds from India as a contributing factor to the pollution. When India’s Met department disputed the claim providing their own analysis of wind patterns post-Diwali, Islamabad promptly clarified it is not blaming India for Lahore’s pollution, attributing the AQI spike to crop residue burning, industrial emissions, and the annual October-November pollution crisis in Pakistan. Additionally, Secretary for Environment and Climate Change Raja Jahangir Anwar said that there is a need to acknowledge climate diplomacy as a “regional and global issue.”However, amid worsening air quality in Lahore, Pakistani minister Marriyum Aurangzeb cited winds from India as a contributing factor to the pollution.

The Hindu,2024-09-18 00:00:00,"HC notice to MCD Commissioner, North West district DCF over deconcretisation of trees","New Delhi

The High Court here has issued a notice to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) Commissioner and North West district’s Deputy Conservator of Forests (DCF) asking as to why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against them for violating its orders by not acting against deconcretisation of trees.

In its September 13 order, the court directed them to file a reply within a week.

“Prima facie, I am satisfied that the MCD as well as the DCF, North West, are guilty of contempt of the directions passed by this court and should be punished for the contempt of court,” Justice Jasmeet Singh said. The court’s order came while hearing an application seeking directions to the MCD and the Forest Department for the deconcretisation of a banyan tree in Old Rajinder Nagar here. The applicant also sought initiation of contempt proceedings against the erring officers. It was stated that the banyan tree, which seemed to be at least 60 years old, was concretised, and due to the weakening of the roots caused by it, the tree tilted and was threatening an adjoining house. The plea stated that instead of deconcretising the tree, the MCD sought permission for heavy pruning and no inspection was done by the Forest Department. On September 6, personnel from the Horticulture Department of the MCD “incessantly” pruned the tree, leaving it completely bereft of any leaves, the plea said. After perusing the photographs, the court said, “Despite the order having been passed more than two and a half years ago, there are no steps, which are visible on ground, showing deconcretisation of trees and compliance of orders of this court. The present case is a classic example of total disregard for the orders passed by this court and lack of due care”. “Let a notice be issued to the Commissioner, MCD, as well as to the DCF, North West, as to why contempt action should not be taken against them for violating orders passed by this court,” the court said.","The Delhi High Court has issued a contempt notice to the MCD Commissioner and North West Delhi’s DCF for not complying with its orders on deconcretisation of trees, particularly a 60-year-old banyan tree in Old Rajinder Nagar. The court criticized the authorities for disregarding its directives and failing to protect trees.",Local News,51,335

Mint,2024-07-04 00:00:00,The underground network sneaking Nvidia chips into China,"A 26-year-old Chinese student in Singapore was packing suitcases last fall to return home for vacation. Besides his clothes and shoes, his luggage included six of Nvidia ’s advanced artificial-intelligence chips.

A connection from college asked him to bring the chips because the U.S. restricted their export to China. Each chip was roughly the size of a Nintendo Switch game console, and the student didn’t flag any suspicions at the airport.

Upon arrival, the student said he was paid $100 for each chip he carried, a fraction of the underground market worth.

The student is part of a barely concealed network of buyers, sellers and couriers bypassing the Biden administration’s restrictions aimed at denying China access to Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, The Wall Street Journal has found. Nvidia’s chips are highly coveted for their ability to handle the massive computations needed to train AI systems that are critical to China-U.S. tech rivalry.

More than 70 distributors are openly advertising online what they purport to be Nvidia’s restricted chips, and the Journal got in direct contact with 25 of them. Many of the verified sellers said they have supplies amounting to dozens of the high-end Nvidia chips each month.

The flow of Nvidia chips is so steady that most of those sellers take preorders and promise delivery in weeks, the Journal found. Some also sold entire servers—costing upward of roughly $300,000—with each containing eight high-end Nvidia chips.

These merchants don’t sell enough of the powerful Nvidia processors to satiate a single tech giant’s demands. But for AI startups or research institutions with more modest needs, procurement can be done. Every Nvidia chip matters to China, which wants to stay competitive with the U.S. in an AI race seen as increasingly crucial to tech sovereignty and national security .

The Chinese sellers could be advertising Nvidia chips they don’t actually have or offering refurbished ones from older processors. But counterfeits would be nearly impossible to make, both in physical or performance terms, given the uniqueness of Nvidia’s top-end products.

The Journal’s review includes verifying purchases with Chinese buyers who used the underground channels, as well as access to transaction records, customs filings and photos of the Nvidia chips up for sale. The Commerce Department, which oversees enforcement of the U.S. restrictions, didn’t respond to requests for comment.

Tracking troubles

Nvidia globally doesn’t sell its powerful data-center chips individually or provide them directly to its AI customers. Instead, it ships them to third parties , such as Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer , which deliver fully-built AI servers or systems to those customers. These equipment providers often order more Nvidia chips than they need, in case demand unexpectedly surges or they run into manufacturing snags, according to industry participants. The equipment providers’ visibility would also be limited if the end buyer chooses to route the servers—and the Nvidia chips inside them—to elsewhere, the participants added.

Dell and Super Micro said they comply with U.S. export controls and act if illicit behavior is discovered.

Nvidia says it doesn’t sell its restricted advanced chips to China, in accordance with the U.S. export controls, and it works primarily with well-known partners to comply with the rules. “We apply the same standard to all transactions, large or small, and expect our partners to do the same,” an Nvidia spokesperson said.

Enforcement of the Biden administration’s export curbs on Nvidia chips largely rests with the Commerce Department and the myriad companies along the semiconductor supply chain. Many foreign governments and jurisdictions aren’t legally required to impose the U.S. controls, and such chip sales to China aren’t generally considered a criminal offense in those places, according to international trade lawyers.

For instance, the student transporting the Nvidia chips didn’t break any Singaporean laws, according to the lawyers, as the tech components aren’t subject to any local export restrictions.

“Whether these transactions occur through distributors or intermediaries is very difficult to track,” said Frank Kung, an analyst at TrendForce who focuses on semiconductors and cloud data centers.

The free flow of Nvidia’s top-end chips in China began to dry up in late 2022 after Washington imposed a first round of export restrictions. Nvidia offered scaled-down versions for Chinese buyers, but Washington further limited access to such chips in October. That move led to the cancellation of hundreds of thousands of Nvidia orders, worth at least $5 billion .

Some Chinese companies have considered temporary solutions that can help them survive the U.S. restrictions until local chip makers such as Huawei Technologies are capable of making better alternatives , people familiar with the matter say.

The precise scale of the informal market for Nvidia’s advanced chips couldn’t be learned but is believed to be relatively small compared with the overall market. One estimate put the median number of AI chips smuggled annually at 12,500, according to an analysis by the Center for a New American Security, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. However, Nvidia sold worldwide last year an estimated more than 2.6 million A100 and H100 chips, along with their scaled-down versions, according to tech research firm Omdia.

The power of ‘Brother Jiang’

The chips that the Chinese student carried to China were passed down from a mysterious broker in Singapore known as “Brother Jiang,” who is well known among chip distributors and buyers in the region. In interviews with the Journal, he said he taps contacts at distribution channels and system integrators in Southeast Asia to help Chinese customers get chips and servers. He said his clients include AI companies, research institutions and chip resellers, some of which have used entities set up in Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and Taiwan to circumvent U.S. restrictions.

After placing orders, he also helped his buyers arrange logistics. That process could mean an individual ferrying in the product, or a more traditional delivery where Jiang helped prepare documents for customs declaration and contact with shipping companies.

“We don’t do big orders. That would be too conspicuous,” said the broker, who said he has worked in the cloud-computing and chip industry for more than a decade.

The system relies, in part, on incomplete paperwork that can avoid triggering authorities, some of the sellers say. In two March transactions, a Shenzhen, China-based merchant received shipments of 20 Nvidia GPUs from Singapore and an additional 40 from a Taiwan-based exporter—without specifying what the chip models were, according to customs filings seen by the Journal.

The seller told the Journal that the chips were one of the most off-limits: the high-end A100 processors.

‘There is always a way’

The distributors that the Journal found have circulated product information in industry-group chats, online yellow pages of electronics suppliers and e-commerce sites such as Alibaba ’s Taobao and Idle Fish. Many run bricks-and-mortar outlets in China’s leading AI-research hubs such as Shenzhen and Beijing.

These resellers typically asked $22,500 for an A100 chip and $32,400 for the higher-end H100—a premium versus the typical costs of roughly $10,000 and $25,000 for the pair of processors, respectively. The underground-market prices have already more than halved from last summer, as supply has become more stable while panic buying has abated, the sellers said.

Some merchants said they have up to dozens of chips in stock at one time, and preorders of bigger quantities can be delivered in one to two weeks. The chips come in their original wholesale packaging, they said.

“It does become very hard, but don’t be silly, there is always a way,” said a Beijing-based distributor when asked about how they managed to get the chips. He added he has received a shipment every month, dozens of chips each, over the past few months.

Some sellers offer a three-year quality assurance plan, including replacing defective products and repairing malfunctions—but without involving Nvidia. Buyers said they were concerned about the uncertainty of unofficial aftersale services.

After Washington tightened export restrictions late last year, Chinese research institutes and universities continued to buy Nvidia’s high-end AI chips in limited quantities from resellers in China, according to official procurement documents reviewed by the Journal . The purchases include H100, a processor that Nvidia never officially shipped to China as the export restrictions took effect before the chips went on sale globally.

China’s elite Tsinghua University and state research powerhouse Chinese Academy of Science have been among the main buyers of Nvidia’s advanced AI chips, according to the documents.

Chinese tech companies including U.S.-sanctioned Huawei are attempting to make chips as capable as Nvidia’s but are faced with capacity and technology bottlenecks , people familiar with the matter say. Training large AI models with domestic chips is prone to system crashes, a top AI research institution told Chinese Premier Li Qiang in March, according to a presentation reviewed by the Journal.

Until viable domestically-made chips emerge in China, the market for Nvidia’s high-end products—and the supply chain that has sprouted around them—will likely remain robust and adaptive. The Chinese student who brought Nvidia processors in his suitcase said he is willing to transport the tech components again.

“I’m glad I was able to do something for my country—and make a little extra money,” the student said. “So, why not?”","A smuggling network bypasses U.S. restrictions, delivering Nvidia's AI chips to China. Over 70 online distributors sell these restricted chips, crucial for AI development. Sellers offer preorders, promising delivery within weeks, and sell entire servers with Nvidia chips. Smugglers use various methods, including luggage transport and incomplete customs paperwork. Brokers facilitate these transactions, sourcing chips from Southeast Asia.

Enforcement is challenging as Nvidia ships to third-party manufacturers, making end-buyer tracking difficult. Resellers charge premiums for the chips, offering uncertain after-sales services. Chinese research institutions are among the buyers. Demand persists until viable domestic alternatives emerge.",International News,95,1524

Ahead of the protest march by leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, rice millers and commission agents against the tardy paddy procurement, various union leaders have been invited for talks by Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Saturday evening.

The members and leaders of farmer unions and associations of arhtiyas and rice millers have left from all over Punjab and are headed towards Chandigarh. However, the leaders are alleging that they are being stopped by the police on the outskirts of the city.

Raminder Singh, an SKM leader, said that several farmers coming with him had been stopped at the Airport Road. “Many others, including Balbir Singh Rajewal, have been stopped at Bhago Majra,” he said, adding that a decision on the protest march to the CM’s residence would be taken once all stakeholders reached Kisan Bhawan.
All three stakeholders in the paddy procurement--farmers, rice millers and commission agents--have been protesting since the paddy procurement season began. While farmers are alleging harassment saying no space was available to keep paddy in mandis, millers have refused to mill the paddy, though they have agreed to give their space to the government to keep the paddy.

Commission agents, on the other hand, are demanding that their commission be restored at 2.5 per cent of the paddy MSP. It was capped at Rs 46 per quintal a few years ago.","Members and leaders of farmer unions, rice millers, and commission agents from Punjab have commenced a protest march toward Chandigarh, demanding prompt action on slow paddy procurement.

The event is expected to unveil the much-anticipated iPhone 16 Series, alongside other gadgets. However, with new products on the horizon, it is also likely that several current Apple devices will be phased out.

According to a recent report from 9To5Mac, here is a rundown of the Apple products that might be discontinued following the keynote.

iPhone 15 Pro & iPhone 15 Pro Max

Since the introduction of the iPhone XS and XR in 2018, Apple has typically retired flagship iPhones a year after their debut, likely due to the minimal differences between successive models, reported the publication.

As per the report, this trend suggests that the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max might be on their way out. The iPhone 15 Pro was notable for being Apple’s first iPhone to feature a titanium frame, and it is likely that this will be the last model with the current 6.1-inch and 6.7-inch screen sizes, as the iPhone 16 Pro models are expected to have larger displays. Additionally, the distinctive Blue Titanium color of the iPhone 15 Pro may not make a return in the upcoming series.

iPhone 14 Plus
Reportedly, the iPhone 14 Plus marked Apple’s return to offering a large, entry-level iPhone, following the less successful iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 13 mini. With its 6.7-inch display and robust battery life, it provided a more affordable alternative to the Pro Max models. The iPhone 14 Plus also revived the “Plus"" branding after a hiatus since the iPhone 8 Plus. Given Apple’s pattern of discontinuing certain models while keeping others around for longer, the iPhone 14 Plus may be discontinued, with the iPhone 14 likely remaining available for a bit longer.

iPhone 13
Introduced in 2021, the iPhone 13 brought notable upgrades, including improved battery life, a new camera system, and a smaller notch. It remains one of the oldest iPhone currently available from Apple. As per the report, if past patterns hold true, the iPhone 13 might be retired, with the iPhone 14 taking over at the $599 price point, at least until the release of the iPhone SE 4.
Apple Watch Series 9, Ultra 2, and SE 2
All three Apple Watch models are due for potential updates. The Series 10 is anticipated to feature larger, more efficient displays, a slimmer profile, and possibly a new chipset. The Ultra 3 might receive a minor refresh, and the SE 3 is rumored to adopt a plastic casing to offer a more budget-friendly option. If these updates occur, the current Series 9, Ultra 2, and SE 2 models could be phased out.

AirPods 2 and AirPods 3
The AirPods 2, introduced in 2019, have been a popular entry-level option, while the AirPods 3, launched in 2021, brought improvements like Spatial Audio. However, with the expected debut of two new AirPods 4 models—one entry-level and one mid-tier—iti ’s likely that the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 will be discontinued. The new mid-tier AirPods are expected to feature noise cancellation, a feature not present in the AirPods 2.

iPad mini 6 and iPad 10
Apple is also likely to refresh its more affordable iPads. The iPad mini 6 and iPad 10 may be replaced by new models, with potential updates including support for Apple Intelligence, increased storage, and Apple Pencil Pro compatibility.

EIGHTEEN people were killed and 19 injured when a doubledecker sleeper bus headed for Delhi hit a milk tanker on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway here on Wednesday, officials said. The accident occurred around 5 am near Jojikot village in Behta Mujhawar police station area. District Magistrate Gaurang Rathi said, it appears that the bus, which was coming from Motihari in Bihar, was speeding and hit the milk tanker from behind. Eighteen people died and 19 were injured in the accident. A probe has been launched into the matter, he said. Rathi said 20 passengers who sustained minor injuries were sent to Delhi in another bus, which was carrying 60 people. Additional Director General of Police, Lucknow, S B Shiradkar told PTI that 14 men, three women and a child were killed in the accident. Bangarmau Circle Officer (CO) Arvind Kumar said due to the collision, both the bus and milk tanker overturned. Drivers of the two vehicles were among the dead.
 
He said the injured were rushed to a hospital and their condition was stated to be stable. Glass shards and people’s belongings lay scattered on the highway next to the overturned bus and milk tanker. Cranes were used to put the two vehicles back on their wheels and they were later towed away. The impact of the collision left the front portion of the bus badly mangled with one side ripped open. “We were sleeping. I don’t know what happened,” Mohd Shamim, a passenger who sustained head injuries in the accident, told reporters at the hospital.

The Indian Express,2024-09-21 00:00:00,Are Insta moments taking the thrill out of hilltops?,"Travel was once an essential endeavour if you wanted to discover a world beyond your own. The beauty of a faraway region could be appreciated only after long days of voyaging. The minutiae of life in a new city – the local customs, the provincial cuisine – had to be experienced first-hand. Books and travel magazines, if you took the trouble to consult them, may have painted broad brushstrokes of your destination but the canvas remained inchoate until you journeyed to see it with your own eyes.

Now, in the digital age, the world can be viewed in the palm of one’s hand. In How To Travel Without Seeing, writer and poet Andrés Neuman, remarked: “These days we go places without moving. Sedentary nomads, we can learn about a place and travel there in an instant. Nevertheless, or perhaps consequently, we stay at home, rooted in front of the screen…Wherever we go, we remain within the same landscape: the landscape of communications.”

This modern landscape of communications has blanched the mystique associated with travel. There is little room for surprise when day-by-day itineraries and listicles of ‘hidden gems’ clinically dissect every conceivable locale. With images of every corner of the planet just a few clicks away, travel no longer offers the thrill of discovery. Instead, it now lures you with a different promise: an escape from monotony.

When you travel, you get a chance to lay aside your assigned roles and duties, and play out an alternate existence. It affords a brief respite from the humdrum of home. No matter your travel philosophy – whether it’s must-see-top-sights or slow, deliberative exploration – there is a desire to leave behind the quotidian life, to shape your vacation days as counterpoints to your daily routines. For some, an annual visit to a favourite city can be enough to scratch this itch for change; for others, a whirlwind trip of a new country is an adequate taste of the exotic. And then there are those, whose love for unusual travel can manifest in more ominous ways.

If you belong to this last category, you are sure to exhibit the peculiar characteristics of this itinerant species. You can willingly forego the benefits of plumbing and go days without taking a bath. When someone makes you walk for miles in the wilderness – trudging through mud and snow, stumbling over boulders and springs – you are able to successfully quell your desire to bash their head in with a rock. You think nothing of getting drenched in the rain and being crisped by the sun, all in the course of one morning. Bent under the weight of your pack and plodding uphill on weary legs, you can suppress the longing to leap off the cliff just to bring an end to your suffering. And, most crucially, you can dip into your deepest well of fortitude, plumb the depths of your forbearance, to endure a breakfast of oats porridge.

Later, when you return to civilization with tales of your (mis)adventures and people look at you with a mix of concern, pity, and alarm, you likely assuage them by saying that no holiday can feel as enlivening as one spent hiking in the great outdoors. You’re quite right, of course.

In 1923, an editorial in The Guardian touted the benefits of ‘rambling’ in the mountains and moorlands, thus: “… every time one spends a long day among the heather or the peat; a coating of the almost inevitably ­incipient parasitism that comes of living always in a crowd falls from you; you “breathe deep and are yourself”..”. Over a century later, these words ring truer than ever.

To city-dwellers accustomed to being boxed in by glass-and-steel towers, having the run of an alpine meadow can feel liberating. While the traffic gridlock at busy intersections triggered rage, waiting for mountain goats to cross a trail prompts a smile. On a steep ridgeline, the din of urban spaces can be traded for silence broken only by the whip of the wind. Every year, thousands of hikers make a beeline for the mountains – venturing into wild expanses untamed by humanity – hoping to earn a measure of this solitude; preferably, while enjoying a mountaintop view.

For centuries, the high-altitude view has enamoured poets and philosophers alike. There is something surreal about observing the world from a height – to see the hills rolling into the horizon, streams thinning into ribbons, and lakes sparkling like freshly-minted coins. As Robert Macfarlane so eloquently wrote in Mountains of the Mind, when you’re on top of a mountain: “… the only limits to how far you can see are the mechanical limits of your vision. Otherwise, you are panoptic, satellitic, an all-seeing I…. And that is an unforgettable sensation.”

This sensation can also acquire a dark edge. The history of mountaineering is littered with stories of climbers – George Mallory, Günther Messner, and countless others – whose obsession with summits claimed their lives. But for the amateur hiker, this ‘inverted gravity of mountain-going’, as Macfarlane calls it, need not be only about conquering peaks. After all, there is much else that mountain travel has to offer and every foray into the highlands can feel different.

At Beas Kund, you are greeted by a phalanx of snow-capped sentinels standing vigil over the emerald pool as the headwaters of the river thread through the sparse valley. During a night march to Pangarchulla, the clear skies and starlight turn the mountainside into a moonscape. In the Rupin Valley, you can camp at the foot of a thundering, three-tiered waterfall, a bank of yellow blossoms neighbouring your tent. On the rope lines leading up to Friendship Peak, a bout of vertigo can assail you when you peer into the depths of a crevasse. In the forests above Rimbick, where the hills of North Bengal crest into Sikkim, rhododendrons abound, and further north-west, the trail to Kuari Pass leads you into an icy, inhospitable wasteland.

These sights, though awe-inspiring, are rarely unforeseen. In the course of your research and preparation, you inevitably trawl through trekking websites and galleries highlighting the many photogenic vistas that the hiking route will present. And so, later, when you stand on a ledge after hours of climbing and look at the chevron of jagged peaks on the horizon, you are robbed of the feeling of newness, of having discovered this view.

But, as it turns out, this is of little consequence. You will keep returning to the mountains – hauling your rucksack and clutching your trekking poles – because it is not discovery that you’re after. It is the opportunity to flee the ordered life you’ve built in the plains, to collect memories that will sustain you through months of monotony until you can travel again.","This essay explores the shift in travel experiences from the past to the digital age, where the thrill of discovery is diminished by constant online accessibility. Despite modern conveniences, people still seek travel as an escape from monotony, particularly through outdoor adventures like hiking. The author delves into the appeal of mountain trekking, which offers liberation from urban life and a connection with nature. Though research and digital previews of scenic vistas reduce the element of surprise, the value of such journeys lies in their ability to provide respite from daily routines. The essay emphasizes that travel today is less about new discoveries and more about finding temporary freedom from structured life.",Opinion and Editorial,112,1133

Business Standard,2024-10-17 00:00:00,"Sensex tanks 495 pts, Nifty at 24,750; Why India stock markets fell today?","Stock market highlights, market news: The BSE Sensex fell below the 81,000-mark intraday, while the NSE Nifty tested 24,700 during the day
Domestic benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty on Thursday, October 17, plunged amid the expiry of the weekly Nifty50 derivative (F&O) contracts. The BSE Sensex closed 494.75 points or 0.61 per cent lower at 81,006.61 levels. The NSE Nifty50, on the other hand, closed at 24,749.85, down 221.45 points or 0.89 per cent.
The indices hit intraday lows of 80,905.64 (down 596 points) and 24,728.90 (242 points), respectively. 
Here are few major reasons that are dragging the indices today: 
Bajaj Auto drags auto index 
Shares of Bajaj Auto dropped 13 per cent in trade after the two-wheeler company said it expects weak festive season sales due to rising inflation, especially in food prices, to limit their purchases. This statement also impacted other automakers and dragged the broader market. At close, the Nifty Auto index was down 3.54 per cent at 24,991. 

""The broad market selloff experienced today was driven by the 2W Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Bajaj Auto’s comment on the weak festival sales, which rippled through the sector,"" said Sagar Shetty, research analyst, StoxBox. 
Shetty added: This comment fueled the investors' already pessimistic outlook, with the already underperforming results of the large-cap stocks.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FII) selling 
As per Shetty, the FII diverting their funds into Chinese markets worsened the market sentiment. 
On Wednesday, as per NSE data, FII sold Rs 3,435.94 crore worth of equities in the Indian markets. 
Weakness in Asian stocks 
China's mainline CSI 300, Shanghai, and Hong Kong's Heng Seng were down over 1 per cent in trade as the housing policy briefing in China failed to excite investors and property stocks slumped.
Chinese Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Ni Hong said on Thursday that they will expand a ""white list"" of housing projects eligible for financing and increase bank lending for such developments to 4 trillion yuan ($562 billion) by year-end.
Similarly, Japan's Nikkei last seen was trading lower by 0.64 per cent after weak September trade data.
Early today, Japan posted a fall in its September exports for the first time in 10 months by 1.7 per cent as against a growth of 4.3 per cent for the same period last year. Meanwhile, its imports for September came in at 2.1 per cent also missing the expectations of economists of 3.2 per cent. The figure was down from August’s growth of 2.3 per cent.
Big initial public offer (IPO) withdrawing liquidity 
Analysts believe that big IPOs like Hyundai Motor India IPO are impacting the liquidity in the secondary market. 
""Hyundai Motor India IPO size is Rs 28,000 crore. Such large IPOs tend to put some pressure on secondary markets as some amount of liquidity is withdrawn,"" said Manish Jain, director - institutional business (equity & fi) division, Mirae Asset Capital Markets. 
Delayed rate cut expectations
With a sharp rise in domestic inflation, the interest rate cut expectations are to be delayed. 
India's annual retail inflation came in at 5.49 per cent in September, its highest level in nine months, due to rising food prices. It rose sharply from 3.65 per cent in August and was above economists' forecast of 5.04 per cent. 
""CPI print came at 9 month high which in the medium term gives the feeling that rate cut might be delayed and the prices may remain elevated for some more time,"" said Jain. 
Technicals
Short term structure for the Nifty index, according to Aditya Agarwal, head of derivatives & technical analysis at Sanctum Wealth, looks weak and sell on rallies strategy can be used by traders.
On higher side, the Nifty index will find strong resistance around 24,950-25,050 levels and move towards those levels will be used by traders to reduce long exposure. A close below, 24,700 will trigger another round of selling that can drag index further towards 24,440/24,180 levels, he said. 
""Over the last 5-6 trading sessions, Nifty has been encountering strong resistance in the range of 25,200 to 25,250. This resistance level coincides with the 21-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), which has been a key technical barrier for the index. This convergence of resistance levels has contributed to today's market decline. Additionally, the volatility associated with the weekly expiry has added to the market's uncertainty,"" said Jigar S Patel, senior manager - technical research analyst, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers.","On October 17, the BSE Sensex fell below 81,000, closing down 494.75 points (0.61%) at 81,006.61, while the NSE Nifty dropped 221.45 points (0.89%) to 24,749.85. Both indices hit intraday lows, influenced by factors including a 13% decline in Bajaj Auto shares due to weak festive sales forecasts, foreign institutional investor (FII) selling, and weakness in Asian markets. The IPO of Hyundai Motor India also contributed to liquidity pressures. Rising domestic inflation, recorded at 5.49% in September, has delayed interest rate cut expectations, further impacting market sentiment. Technical analysis suggests potential further declines if Nifty closes below 24,700.",Stock Market Update,98,736
Indian Express,2025-01-01 00:00:00,"Rajiv Kapoor was addicted to alcohol, Khushbu Sundar says everyone was very worried for him: ‘We spoke a day before his death’","Actor Rajiv Kapoor, the youngest brother of actors Rishi Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor, was only 58 when he lost his life. He died of a heart attack in 2021, a year after Rishi passed away due to cancer. He was great friends with veteran actor Khushbu Sundar, who recently shared details about his health. Khushbu revealed that alcoholism was a major problem that Rajiv dealt with, and this affected other aspects of his health. She said, “He did have a heart issue, but because of his addiction to alcohol, we knew that it could create a huge problem. We were not successful in making him quit this habit.”

Speaking to Vickey Lalwani, she shared, “He (Rajiv) was keeping extremely low. He had a major issue with his knee, so he underwent a couple of surgeries. But that didn’t help him at all. We were definitely aware that Chimpu was unwell. I was in Bombay when Chimpu died. I was informed about his death by Boney Kapoor. He called me and said, ‘Chimpu is no more’. It came as a rude shock to me.”
Khushbu Sundar shared she had spoken to Rajiv a day before his death. Sharing the details, the actor said, “I spoke to Chimpu just a day before his death. He was down with very high fever and it was during COVID-19. Despite being unwell, he was being his usual self… He was taking his health lightly and promised to meet soon.”

Khushbu shared they were so close that it was a ritual for her to meet him for meals. She said, “His death came as a shock to me. It is very rare to find people with so much liveliness and the commitment towards their friends and friendships. We still believe he is with us.”

Khushbu still hasn’t deleted Rajiv’s phone number. However, she regrets not being in touch with his family, as he was her only connection to them. Speaking about their friendship, the actor shared, “He has taught me so many things. I only put white nail paint on my toes because Chimpu once told me that it’s classy. He had told me this in 1983, and till date, I only use the same paint. He didn’t like the way I walk, so he made me learn how to walk with heels without making any noise.”

Khushbu Sundar and Rajiv Kapoor became friends during the making of the film Ram Teri Ganga Maili. Raj Kapoor had first decided to launch her with the 1985 film, but because she was just 14 at that time, the filmmaker-actor cast Mandakini in the role instead.","Khushbu Sundar shared her deep sorrow over the death of her close friend, actor Rajiv Kapoor, who passed away from a heart attack in 2021. She revealed that Rajiv struggled with alcoholism, which worsened his health, and although they tried to help him, his addiction remained a major challenge. Khushbu recalled their close bond, reminiscing about their shared meals and conversations, and fondly remembered how Rajiv taught her small life lessons, such as wearing white nail polish and walking gracefully in heels.",Entertainment,82,464

The Navhind Times,2024-09-06 00:00:00,SC slams Dhami for ignoring objections to officer’s posting,"PTI

New Delhi

Heads of governments cannot be expected to be “old days’ kings” and we are not in a “feudal era”, the Supreme Court said on Wednesday, questioning Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami for appointing an IFS officer as the director of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, disregarding the opinions of the state’s forest minister and others.

The court observed that a departmental proceeding was pending against the officer concerned.

However, the state government told a bench headed by Justice B R Gavai that the order posting the Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer as the director of the tiger reserve was withdrawn on September 3.

The bench was hearing a matter concerning the appointment of IFS officer Rahul, a former director of the Corbett Tiger Reserve, as the director of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve. The court observed that there was a specific noting right from the first officer, which was endorsed by the deputy secretary, the principal secretary and also by the state’s forest minister that Rahul should not be posted as the director of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve.

Pointing out that the noting had said the officer should not be posted at the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, the court said the chief minister “just ignores it”.

“If you disagree right from the desk officer, the deputy secretary, the principal secretary, the minister, then the least that is expected is that there is some application of mind as to why he is disagreeing with the proposal,” it said.

“There is something like a public trust doctrine in this country. The heads of the executive cannot be expected to be old days’ kings that whatever they have said, they will do,” the bench observed, adding, “We are not in a feudal era.”

“Why should the chief minister have special affection for him (the officer)?” the bench asked, adding, “Just because he is the chief minister, can he do anything?” It also observed that a departmental proceeding was pending against the officer concerned.

Senior advocate ANS Nadkarni, appearing in the court on behalf of the state, said the officer was not facing any FIR lodged either by the state police or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

The lawyer said the disciplinary proceeding against the officer was related to the Corbett Tiger Reserve where several officers were served show-cause notices.","The Supreme Court criticized Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami for appointing IFS officer Rahul as the director of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, despite departmental objections and a pending disciplinary proceeding. The court questioned the chief minister's disregard for the state's forest minister and other officials' recommendations against the appointment, stating that heads of government cannot act like ""old days’ kings"" and must apply reason. The state government informed the court that the officer's appointment was withdrawn on September 3. Rahul, formerly the director of Corbett Tiger Reserve, is under investigation but not facing any FIRs.",Crime and Justice,96,393

Indian Express,2025-01-04 00:00:00,Can a smartwatch help you quit smoking?,"Smartwatches may be the latest in wearable technology that can aid smokers in quitting cigarettes.“Remember why you wanted to quit.”

Imagine your smartwatch vibrating and flashing such a message every time you lift your hand to smoke a cigarette. Will this be enough to jolt smokers trying to quit from relapsing?

In case you are among the millions struggling to quit smoking, here is some good news. Researchers from the University of Bristol have come up with the first “just-in-time” intervention app to prevent relapse. Smoking is one of the biggest hurdles to leading a healthy life. Quitting is challenging as nicotine addiction can lead to lasting dependence, often leading to withdrawal symptoms. Although most smokers manage to quit temporarily, abstaining seems like a bigger struggle, with up to 75 per cent relapsing within the first year.The research – Presenting and Evaluating a Smartwatch-Based Intervention for Smoking Relapse (StopWatch): Feasibility and Acceptability Study – published in JMIR Formative Research, shows how smartwatches can provide just-in-time support for smokers at risk of relapse. The team has developed motion sensor software that can detect hand movements that occur when a person is holding a cigarette. Each time a cigarette is detected, the app pushes an alert on the smartwatch screen, and it also sends text messages along with vibration. These messages are designed by smokers and former smokers extending support to those trying to quit.The team conducted the study on 18 participants who were daily smokers, actively seeking to quit, and those who smoked using their right hand. The participants wore the smartwatch every day for two weeks. The researchers developed the StopWatch intervention using an approach that focuses on user-centric design principles. They developed an algorithm that has the ability to detect smoking gestures through the motion sensors in a smartwatch. Later, the smartwatch offers supportive, real-time messages to encourage users to stay committed to quitting their smoking habit. The participants received real-time intervention texts whenever they attempted smoking. The study concluded with qualitative feedback from participants who were required to fill out a questionnaire.

How does StopWatch work, and why smartwatches?
The algorithm in the StopWatch system uses the smartwatch’s accelerometer and gyroscope to process data. These sensors are capable of detecting hand movements related to smoking gestures. In case smoking is identified, the watch sends supportive messages to the user. These messages include words of encouragement, reminders of health benefits, and alerts about smoking habits. “You’ve already avoided X cigarettes today! Keep going!” or “Remember why you wanted to quit,” are some of the messages that flash on the smartwatch screen.

Based on the research, smartwatches are worn on the wrist, which makes them the ideal device to offer real-time intervention. Smartphones, on the other hand, are not always immediately available. As part of the study, the participants were asked to wear the watch daily, charge it overnight, and give feedback about their experience. After the two weeks, many participants reported that the intervention increased their awareness about smoking triggers. They said that the real-time messages acted as reminders and encouraged them to stay committed to their goal. However, some of the participants also cited battery life and bulkiness of the smartwatch as challenges related to the device experience.Perhaps the biggest advantage of the StopWatch system is its ability to intervene at the exact moment a user is about to relapse. Based on the study, the just-in-time approach disrupts some automatic smoking behaviours and provides immediate support. Although the intervention was promising, there were limitations such as battery life, comfort, and some participants even reported false detections where non-smoking gestures triggered push alerts. While the study shows that smartwatch-based interventions are acceptable and feasible, the researchers acknowledge that improvements are needed.

This study sheds light on how wearable technology can be put to a meaningful role in healthcare. As more such technologies evolve, it could potentially redefine how we approach everyday health concerns.

","The University of Bristol developed the StopWatch app, using smartwatches to help smokers avoid relapse by detecting smoking gestures through motion sensors.

Test cricket is where I belong the most, asserts Pant

Pant hit his sixth Test century, his first since returning to competitive cricket after recovering from injuries he suffered in a horrific car accident in December 2022, on the third day of the opening Test against Bangladesh.Thanks to hundreds by Pant and Shubman Gill, India set Bangladesh an improbable target of 515, but the visitors fell way short of the mark after being bowled out for 234 in their second innings at Chepauk.

""100 was special because I love playing in Chennai. After injury I wanted to play all three formats and this was my first Test. Hope to get better every day,"" Pant said after the India's 280-run win.

""It was emotional, I wanted to score each and every match which didn't happen but wanted to do well in Tests, which is where I belong the most. Being on the field gives me pleasure more than anything else.""


Playing in the manner that defines his batting, Pant struck a fluent 109 off 128 balls, lacing his innings with 13 fours and four sixes. The keeper-batter added 167 runs for the fourth wicket with Gill and helped lift India from 67/3 to 287/4 declared in their second essay.

I don't know what people say outside but I try to read the situation in my own way. When you are 30-3, you need to stitch a partnership. That's what Gill and I did.

""To do it with a guy who I have a great relationship with is special,"" Pant said.

After Pant and Gill's exploits with the bat, senior off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin completed a memorable all-round outing with a six-wicket haul as a dominant India crushed the visitors with more than five sessions to spare.


First-inning centurion Ashwin did the bulk of the damage, while Ravindra Jadeja picked up 3/58.

Skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto top-scored for Bangladesh with an 82 off 127 balls.

Pegula entered this year’s main draw with six Grand Slam quarterfinals to her name in her last 14 appearances at the majors, though this year she had not been past the second round at any major.

The victory is Pegula's fourth career win over Swiatek and first since the 2023 Omnium Banque Nationale. She joined Aryna Sabalenka, Elena Rybakina and Barbora Krejcikova as the only players to notch four wins over the Pole, according to WTA stats.

Business Standard,2024-09-02 00:00:00,India can't rely on wealthy to drive growth: Ex-RBI Dy Guv Viral Acharya,"India can’t rely on wealthy individuals to drive growth and expect the overall economy to improve, Viral Acharya, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said on Monday.

Acharya, who is the C V Starr Professor of Economics in the Department of Finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business (NYU-Stern), said after the Covid-19 pandemic, rural consumption and investments have weakened.

“We can’t be pumping our growth through the rich and expect that the economy as a whole will do better,” he said while speaking at an event organised by Elara Capital here.

“If there has to be a trickle-down, it should have actually happened by now,” Acharya said, adding that when the rich keep getting wealthier and wealthier, they have a savings problem.

“The bank account keeps getting bigger, hence they look for financial assets to invest in. India is closed, so our money can't go outside India that easily. So, it has to chase the limited financial assets in the country and a lot of the prices in that space have gone up but it doesn't boost India's consumption,” Acharya added.

He further said that India's consumption and GDP growth have struggled to recover to pre-Covid levels, with rural areas particularly lagging behind urban centres.

“India's consumption, which took a big nosedive after Covid, has rebounded, but it has not caught up unlike the United States,” he noted.

This disparity has contributed to slower overall growth, exacerbated by weak investment and reduced government expenditure, Acharya said, adding, that “the slowdown in foreign direct investment reflects this trend”.

Despite improvements in urban consumption, rural and informal sectors remain weak, partly due to high tariffs that protect domestic industries but hinder broader economic progress. “High tariffs have protected domestic industries but have not boosted broader economic progress,” Acharya stated.

To address these issues, India might consider reducing tariffs, especially in sectors like agriculture, and pursuing reforms in land transfer, power, and finance. “We need to keep tariffs down and undertake reforms in land, power, and finance,” Acharya emphasized.
He said that encouraging private sector growth, improving education standards, and increasing female labour force participation could also enhance economic performance. “The focus should be on achieving higher growth rates and ensuring that economic benefits are more widely distributed, including boosting rural and informal sector growth,” he added.","Viral Acharya, former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India, emphasized that relying on wealthy individuals to drive India's economic growth is unsustainable. Speaking at an Elara Capital event, Acharya highlighted that post-Covid rural consumption and investments have weakened, and overall GDP growth has struggled to recover to pre-pandemic levels. He argued that the wealth accumulated by the rich does not translate into broader economic benefits, as it primarily chases limited financial assets within India, driving up prices but not boosting consumption.

Sitharaman’s response to queries of reporters here came in the backdrop of state political parties protesting the conduct of recent Postal department exams in English and Hindi only.

They had alleged that it was a form of “Hindi imposition” in Tamil Nadu, which incidentally had witnessed a successful anti-Hindi agitation in the 1960s spearheaded by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.

One can question the government if such things were done knowingly or not, but should not jump to a conclusion that it was imposition of the language, she said.

“Central government does not do Hindi imposition,” she asserted.

“If somewhere, at an administrative level, if something happens, don’t come to a conclusion that it is imposition. Definitely there is no imposition (of Hindi). We are also involved in development of Tamil,” she said.

Festive offer
As part of the Centre’s ‘EK Bharat Shreshta Bharat’ scheme, efforts have been made to popularise Tamil in northern states of the country, she added.

“There is no Hindi imposition,” the Union Minister reiterated.

Earlier, political parties, including the ruling AIADMK, had protested against questions in the postal department’s examination for appointments of postmen and assistants in rural areas held last week being only in Hindi and English, and not Tamil.

After the issue echoed in Parliament, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad assured the Rajya Sabha that the examination would now be held in all local languages, as per the notification of May 10, 2019 of the department concerned with examination, including in Tamil.

To a question on views from certain quarters against the budgetary proposal on Zero Budget Farming vis-a-vis agriculture, Sitharaman said it has already been tried out in some states.

“This is a free country and people can give their opinions. But there are states which have done it at the ground level– Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Sikkim and Karnataka– zero budget farming has been helpful to farmers (in these states),” she said.

The proposal was part of the government’s endeavour to double farmers’ incomes, she added.

The number of domestic migrants is estimated to have lowered by around 12 per cent to 40.20 crore between 2011 and 2023, indicating increased economic opportunities across the country, said a report by prime minister's economic advisory panel EAC-PM.
According to a working paper by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM), the number of domestic migrants stood at 40,20,90,396 in 2023, which was 11.78 per cent lower compared to the figure registered as per Census 2011.
The paper titled '400 Million Dreams! Examining volume and directions of domestic migration in India using novel high frequency data', said as per Census 2011, the total number of migrants stood at 45,57,87,621.

Consequently, the paper said, the migration rate which stood at 37.64 per cent of total population as per Census 2011, is estimated to have reduced to 28.88 per cent.
""We hypothesize that this is on account of availability of improved services such as education, health, infrastructure and connectivity as well as improved economic opportunities in or near in major sources of migration and is an indicator of overall economic growth,"" noted the paper authored by former EAC-PM chairman Bibek Debroy.
The paper used three high-frequency and granular data sets -- Indian Railway Unreserved Ticketing System (UTS) data on passenger volumes; mobile telephone subscribers roaming data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), and district level banking data to understand the likely impact of migration at the places of origin.
Looking at the spatial dimensions of travel, the paper said, the top origin districts are coalesced around major urban agglomerations viz. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Kolkata etc.
Not only is this in line with gravity models of migration but perhaps also is a tentative confirmation of priors i.e short distance migration accounts for the largest share of migrants and that distance has a negative effect on labour flows, it added.
The report also noted that the composition of the top five states that attract maximum number of migrants (including intra-state migrants) has changed.
""West Bengal and Rajasthan are the new entrants and while Andhra Pradesh and Bihar are now ranked a notch lower,"" it said.
While pointing out that West Bengal, Rajasthan and Karnataka are the states showing the maximum growth in percentage share of the arriving passengers, the report said Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are the states where the percentage share of total migrants has reduced.
""Mumbai, Bengaluru Urban, Howrah, Central Delhi, Hyderabad are the districts attracting most migrant arrivals, while Valsad, Chittoor, Paschim Bardhaman, Agra, Guntur, Villupuram and Saharsa are the top origin districts,"" it said.
As per the paper, at the state level, Uttar Pradesh-Delhi; Gujarat-Maharashtra; Telangana-Andhra Pradesh, and Bihar-Delhi emerge as the primary dyads of movement.
""At the district level, Murshidabad-Kolkata; Paschim Bardhaman-Howrah; Valsad -Mumbai; Chittoor-Bengaluru Urban, and Surat-Mumbai are the most popular routes for migration between districts,"" the paper said, adding that this has implications for urban planning as well as for planning of transportation networks.
Using TRAI's mobile phone roaming data, the report finds that April-June is the high months for movement with November-December witnessing secondary highs.
A secondary high in winter time is perhaps indicative of travel around the festival/marriage season. January, on the other hand, appears to be the month of lowest travel, it said.
As per Census 2011, just five states -- Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal -- together account for about 48 per cent of the total outbound migrants, which includes within-state migrants as well.
Similarly, just five states -- Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu -- together account for about 48 per cent of all incoming migrants. This includes within-state migrants as well.
In the period from 1991 to 2001, the compounded annual growth rate of the number of migrants was 2.7 per cent. This increased to 3.7 per cent during 2001 to 2011.
Interestingly, in the period from 1991 to 2001, India's workforce grew from 3.17 crore to 4.02 crore (an annual average growth of 2.6 per cent), whereas from 2001 to 2011, the workforce grew from 4.02 crore to 4.82 crore (an annual average growth of 1.99 per cent).","A report by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) highlights a decline in domestic migration in India, with numbers dropping from 45.57 crore in 2011 to 40.20 crore in 2023—a reduction of 11.78%. The migration rate also fell from 37.64% to 28.88% of the population, attributed to improved economic opportunities, education, and infrastructure across regions.
The study used high-frequency datasets, including railway ticketing, mobile roaming data, and banking records, to analyze migration patterns. Short-distance migration dominates, with key routes like Uttar Pradesh-Delhi and Valsad-Mumbai identified. States like West Bengal and Rajasthan saw increased migrant inflows, while Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh experienced declines.
April-June is the peak migration period, with a secondary rise during the winter festival season. The report underscores the need for urban planning and transportation networks to accommodate these shifting patterns. Despite the overall decline, intra-state migration remains significant, with Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal among the top contributors to migrant movement.",National News,158,923

Deccan Chronicle,2024-09-02 00:00:00,"12 killed, roads breached as rain wreaks havoc in state","At least 12 people in different parts of Telangana died on Sunday as torrential rain battered the entire state. Almost all districts reported waterlogging of roads, inundation of lowlying colonies and villages, farms getting washed out, and water bodies and reservoirs brimming with floodwater. Life was thrown out of gear in the entire state especially in Hyderabad, Khammam, Mahbubabad and Warangal, Adilabad districts, which were badlyhit by the incessant rain caused by the depression in the Bay of Bengal.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy and enquired about the flood situation in the state. The Prime Minister appreciated the state government machinery for acting swiftly and extending the relief and rehabilitation measures and assured to send all-weather helicopters for relief work. Union home minister Amit Shah also spoke to the Chief Minister and assured to send flood relief materials to the state.

As the state braced for heavy rain for the next 24 hours, the government declared a holiday for all educational institutions on Monday across the state and postponed all exams scheduled on Monday.

According to Chief Secretary A. Shanti Kumari, there have been breaches to 85 tanks, ponds and canals. NDRF, SDRF teams have been deployed in severelyflood affected areas from Hyderabad and a control room has been established in the secretariat for the purpose. Director-general of Police Dr Jitender said 26 platoons of rescue teams have been kept on standby. Food and water have been supplied to the railway passengers who were stranded in Mahabubabad.

Vehicles heading towards Vijayawada from Hyderabad on the National Highway 65 were diverted to Nalgonda, Miryalaguda and Guntur as floodwater inundated the highway at Jaggayyapet. Similarly, vehicles going to Khammam from Hyderabad were diverted through Nakrekal, Arvepally and Marripeda bunglow. The road to Srisailam has been temporarily closed after landslides were reported from multiple locations on the road between Eegalapenta and Srisailam. Police have also set up a checkpoint at locality to prevent the vehicle movement as precautionary measures.

Waterlogging was reported over railway tracks at several locations, forcing the South Central Railway (SCR) to cancel and divert a number of trains in the state. A railway track was washed away on the outskirts of Tallapoosapally village in Kesamudram mandal in Mahbubabad, halting train services in the region.

The train services were also badly affected on the Vijayawadawarangal route and Vijayawada-khammam routes.

Officials have been instructed to take all measures to prevent any untoward incidents and shift people from the low-lying areas to the relief camps immediately.

In Hyderabad, officials opened sluice gates of the Hussainsagar to release the water. Though Lower Tank Bund, Gandhinagar, Ashoknagar, Chikkadpally and parts of Himayatnagar lie downstream, the newlyconstructed retaining wall stopped the flooding into the low-lying areas.

The Left Canal of the Nagarjunasagar dam developed a breach due to the release of water at Ramachandrapuram, under Nadigudem Mandal in Suryapet. The water from the canal damaged the crop in hundreds of acres in the nearby villages. The Nagarjunasagar project officials stopped the release of water after the breach.

The entire Nallela village in Kuravi mandal of Mahbubabad district got submerged in flood water. The police from Kuravi police station rescued the people trapped on the rooftops of submerged houses. The police and revenue staff have rescued around 90 people from 18 families in the village.

Nagarkurnool superintendent of police warned of landslides in Domalapenta area and asked people to put off their travel plans to Srisailam until the rain subsides.

In the Mancherial district, flood water cut off road connectivity to five villages and washed off a road at

Nakkalapalli in Kotapally mandal. Devotees faced tough times in temple town Basar in Nirmal district as the flood waters reached near the temple premises.

According to reports of the 12 who got washed away, seven drowned in two separate incidents at Theerdhala of Khamm m rural mandal and Nayakangudem of Kusumanchi mandal. While three persons died as two cars got washed away in Nalgonda district, two people were feared dead in Mahbubabad in floodwater.","Heavy rain caused by a depression in the Bay of Bengal led to widespread flooding in Telangana on Sunday, resulting in at least 12 deaths. Several districts, including Hyderabad, Khammam, Mahbubabad, and Warangal, experienced severe waterlogging, inundation of low-lying areas, and damaged infrastructure. Prime Minister Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah offered assistance, and the state government declared a holiday for educational institutions.

livemint,2024-09-17 00:00:00,Proposed PLI scheme for containers hangs in balance after Niti airs concerns,"New Delhi: A government proposal for a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for shipping containers hangs in the balance after the federal think tank Niti Aayog raised cost concerns, prompting the shipping ministry to point to the need for incentives in the first placet to bring down costs.

The domestic cost of manufacturing is significantly higher than global costs —the cost of manufacturing in containers in China is ₹1.5-2 lakh per unit (40 feet dry containers), compared with ₹3.5-4 lakh in India, two people aware of the development said.

The first person said Niti Aayog has suggested that the manufacturing cost of a container in India should not be more than 15-20% higher than global costs. With the average global manufacturing cost of a container ranging from ₹1.5 lakh to ₹2 lakh, the cost of manufacturing in India should not exceed ₹2.4 lakh per container.

“Niti Aayog has told the ministry of ports, shipping and waterways (MoPSW) that if the difference is so large, it would be better to import containers to meet the demand rather than produce them at uncompetitive prices,"" this person said.

The think tank has asked the ministry to justify the PLI scheme.

Justification sought

However, the shipping ministry is of the view that scaling up manufacturing may bring down costs to global levels, and that the PLI scheme is needed to make India self-reliant in container manufacturing.

“Some questions have arisen over the high cost of manufacturing containers in India. But our view has been that an incentive scheme is required to create a manufacturing ecosystem in the country. Costs will fall when manufacturing gets necessary scale,"" T. K. Ramachandran, secretary, MoPSW told Mint.

It is expected that the shipping ministry will put across its view supporting the scheme and look to extending financial assistance to manufacturers through its proposed ₹25,000 crore Maritime Development Fund.

Queries sent to the Niti Aayog and ministry of commerce and industry, remained unanswered at press time. MoPSW also did not answer some other mailed questions related to the scheme.

The government has been working on a PLI scheme for manufacturing shipping-grade containers for some time now to improve domestic availability and cut large scale import, especially from China.

Shortage of containers

The need to boost domestic manufacturing of containers was felt after Indian exporters and importers expressed concern over a global shortage of containers amid the Russia-Ukraine war.

Though the shortage has eased, giving way to ample availability of cheap containers from abroad, there is still a feeling that a manufacturing infrastructure should be developed to insulate the industry from any future risk, keeping in mind India's growing trade volumes.

Also read | Scarcity on high seas hurting India’s exports

Another factor was the government's attempts to lower import dependence on China, which is the largest container supplier globally, accounting for 90-95% worldwide market share.

Plans were advanced enough for the Centre to have earlier identified Bhavnagar in Gujarat to develop a manufacturing hub for containers. A few private companies had even started operations there.

Huge demand exists

According to the government, India requires 350,000 containers every year, which means locally produced containers would find robust demand.

State-run Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor), which is the largest fleet operator of containers across rail and waterways, alone has a requirement of 50,000-60,000 containers in the next three years.

According to the people quoted above, CONCOR recently took deliveries for 16,000 containers made by a private firm for around ₹3 lakh each. This cost would have been substantially lower had domestic manufacturing been mature, they argued.

A high-level committee was formed earlier to promote local container manufacturing and bring it under a PLI and cluster-based manufacturing system. This may now have to wait as the scheme would be scrutinized afresh before a call is taken on its proposed launch.

“There are apprehensions about a glut in container demand. To some extent, it may sound convincing, but what about the scarcity of containers when demand for them rises unexpectedly?"" the second person said.

Ministry moots PLI

A proposal for container PLI was mooted by the shipping ministry early last year but the ministry later put it on hold citing a glut in the latter part of 2023. This proposal called for ₹11,000-crore container to be spent over a nine-year period, beginning 2024-25.

The plan was to manufacture 20-foot high, 40-foot long containers of various configurations. The aim was for India to garner at least 10% of demand from global liners.

S. Ramakrishna, former chairman and now advisor of the Federation of Freight Forwarders Association of India (FFFAI) emphasized the critical need for the government to address the cost and supply of raw materials used in container manufacturing.

“There are many ways to address the high manufacturing costs. Unless the raw materials for containers are competitively manufactured, prices will not decrease. If the government exempts GST on raw material manufacturing, prices will automatically come down,"" S. Ramakrishna told Mint over phone.

“Earlier, China also supported its industries by reducing raw material costs. As a result, their finished products are priced lower than the cost of our raw materials. This is why 95% of containers are being imported from China,"" he said.

The need for a steady supply of containers is also key to the Centre’s efforts to boost domestic cargo transportation through inland waterways and coastal shipping. Besides, the structural weakness is expected to be addressed through the scheme that has been hurting goods exports since the outbreak Covid-19 pandemic.

Sanctions lead to shortage

The sanctions imposed on Russia by the European Union and US following its invasion of Ukraine led to an acute shortage of containers, which in turn increased freight rates and impacted global trade. In the past two years, Covid, too, has disrupted manufacturing and supply of containers globally.

The Economic Survey for FY22 highlighted how the container shortage is impacting trade. It said covid-19-related restrictions on international trade in 2020 affected container movement.

The prolonged partial closure of ports across the world created a glut of containers in some ports and an acute shortage in others. At the same time, because of widespread manufacturing delays, not enough containers were made, said the Economic Survey released by the government.

“With the global economy starting to recover since early 2021, containers, which were stuck at various storage points are not being sent back to service fast enough, resulting in a skewed demand-supply situation for shipping containers, leading to very high shipping rates. During April-September 2021, India spent $14.8 billion on transport services imports, or 65% higher than last year."" said the Survey.

However, over the longer term, a PLI scheme should address creation of an eco-system of cost-competitive raw material suppliers, supported by demand-side measures such as local sourcing norms for containers, commensurate with India’s participation in international trade, the second person said."," A government proposal for a production linked incentive (PLI) scheme for shipping containers hangs in the balance.

They parted ways a year after that but continued to co-parent their son.

Cheryl on Friday shared a photo of Bear and Liam together along with a statement on her Instagram handle. The statement read, ""As I try to navigate this earth-shattering event and work through my own grief at this indescribably painful time, I'd like to kindly remind everyone that we have lost a human being. Liam was not only a pop star and celebrity, he was a son, a brother, an uncle, a dear friend and a father to our 7-year-old son. A son that now has to face the reality of never seeing his father again.""Cheryl Cole also requested and said, ""What is troubling my spirit the most is that one day Bear will have access to the abhorrent reports and media exploitation we have seen in the past two days. It is breaking my heart further that I cannot protect him from that in the future. I am begging you to consider what use some of these reports are serving, other than to cause further harm to everyone left behind picking up the pieces.

The circumstances of Payne's fall are being investigated as a ""doubtful death"" due to protocol, although it appears he was alone when the fall occurred.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, the prosecutor's office stated that Payne ""was going through some kind of outbreak due to substance abuse"" at the time of the incident.

Authorities investigating the scene found evidence inside Payne's room that ""would be narcotics and alcoholic beverages, as well as several destroyed objects and furniture."" Experts are still working to confirm whether the substances found were drugs.

Five witnesses were interviewed, including three hotel staff members and two women who had been with Payne in his room earlier but had left before the fall.

At the interbank foreign exchange market, the local unit opened at 83.45 and hit the intraday high of 83.44 and a low of 83.50 against the American currency during the session.

It finally settled at 83.50 against the dollar, registering a loss of one paisa over the previous close.

On Friday, the rupee settled at 83.49 against the US dollar.

Forex traders said the rupee gained on a weak dollar and decline in crude oil prices. However, weak domestic markets put pressure on the domestic unit.

“The US Dollar declined on disappointing non-farm payrolls report on Friday, which raised expectations that US Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in its September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting,” said Anuj Choudhary — Research Analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.

The Pioneer,2024-09-30 00:00:00,Don’t hesitate to send your sons to Army: Agniveers will be given pensionable job: Shah,"Appealing to the people not to hesitate to send their sons to the Army, the Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday said that Agniveers will be given a pensionable job. Delivering a fiery speech while addressing a ‘Jan Aashirwaad Rally’ at village Dhorka Sector-95 in Gurugram in support of BJP Badshahpur candidate Rao Narbir Singh, Shah said: “Every Agniveer will get pension benefits. The Agniveer scheme was meant to make the Army young.”

 

Targeting Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, Shah said that the Congress leader is a ‘lying machine’. “Rahul Gandhi says that Agniveer Yojana has been brought because the government does not want to give pensionable jobs. I am telling you that every Agniveer will be given a pensionable job.”

 

Also criticizing Congress, he said: “There was a Congress government in Haryana, it ran on cuts, commissions and corruption. The rule of dealers, brokers and sons-in-law was prevalent. In the BJP government, neither dealers nor brokers are left, there is no question of sons-in-law.”

 

He said that during the Hooda Government, the Congress had only developed one district and one caste, but after the BJP gained power, the party had developed the entire state equally. “The party has given jobs based on 'Kharchi and Parchi' system while the BJP has given five lakh jobs without any 'Kharchi and Parchi,” he said.

 

The Home Minister said that the UPA government gave Rs 41,000 crores to Haryana whereas the Modi Government gave Rs 292,000 crores for development to Haryana in 10 years. “PM Modi loves Haryana the most among all the states,” he added.

 

He said that the Congress could not fulfil the promises it made in Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka. “This is their false guarantee, but the BJP has fulfilled the promises it made.”

 

He said that people are raising pro-Pakistan slogans from Congress platforms. “Why is Rahul Gandhi silent? Why doesn't he speak? Congress has become blind in appeasement. Congress and Rahul Gandhi want to bring back Article 370 in Kashmir. Even their three generations cannot bring back Article 370. India's flag has to be hoisted in Kashmir,” he said.

 

He added that as long as the Modi Government is there, only the Tricolour flag will fly in Kashmir.

 

While attacking the Hooda Government, the Home Minister said that brokers, dealers and ‘damaad’ auctioned Gurugram land. “In a public meeting, the Congress candidate says that he will give 50-50 jobs to his supporters. If they give jobs to their supporters from where will the common man get a job,"" he said. He added that Haryana is such a state where every tenth man is in the army.","Union Home Minister Amit Shah, addressing a rally in Gurugram, urged people not to hesitate in sending their sons to the Army, assuring that Agniveers will receive pensionable jobs. He defended the Agniveer scheme as a way to make the Army younger and criticized Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, calling him a “lying machine” for opposing the scheme.

Shah slammed the previous Congress government in Haryana for corruption and nepotism, contrasting it with BJP’s development efforts and job creation without favoritism. He highlighted that the Modi government allocated Rs 292,000 crore for Haryana’s development over ten years, far surpassing the UPA’s Rs 41,000 crore.

He accused Congress of appeasement politics and backing Article 370, stressing that under Modi, only the Indian flag will fly in Kashmir. Shah also condemned Congress’s alleged misuse of land and job promises in Gurugram, emphasizing Haryana’s strong military tradition, with one in every ten men serving in the Army.",National News,153,443
The new Indian Express,2024-09-24 00:00:00,India's Deepthi Jeevanji wins bronze in women's 400m T20 category in Paris Paralympics,"PARIS: India's world champion Deepthi Jeevanji came up short of her best timing as she won a bronze medal in the women's 400m T20 category final race at the Paralympics here on Tuesday.

Deepthi, who turns 21 later this month, clocked 55.82 seconds to finish behind Yuliia Shuliar (55.16 seconds) of Ukraine and world record holder Aysel Onder (55.23) of Turkey.

Shuliar had won a silver in the Tokyo Paralympics three years ago.

Deepthi had come into the Paris Paralympics as a strong contender for the gold after a top-place finish at the World Para-Athletics Championships in May in Japan, where she had clocked the then world record of 55.07 seconds.

Turkish runner Onder smashed Deepthi's world record during the heats on Monday with a time of 54.96 seconds. Onder had finished second behind Deepthi in the 2024 World Para-Athletics Championships in May.

T20 category is meant for athletes with intellectual impairment.

Nonetheless, Deepthi, born to daily-wage labourer parents in Kalleda village in the Warangal district of Telangana, became the second Indian to win a medal in a track event at the Paralympics after Preethi Pal.

On Sunday, Preethi had created history as she became the first Indian woman track and field athlete to win two medals at the Paralympics.

The 23-year-old Preethi bagged a bronze in the 200m T35 category with a personal best time of 30.01 seconds.

She had also won a bronze in the 100m T35 category on Friday.

Deepthi's bronze, won in her debut Paralympics, was India's sixth medal from para-athletics.

For a long time, Deepthi's parents were taunted by fellow villagers for having a ""mentally impaired"" child.

They were at the receiving end of taunts from the villagers, who would often say that she would never get married since she was ""mentally impaired.""

At the age of 15, Deepthi was first spotted by N Ramesh, an Athletics Federation of India coach under the payrolls of the Sports Authority of India.

Deepthi had won the 400m T20 gold in the Hangzhou Asian Games last year with the then Asian record of 56.69 seconds.

Interestingly, Deepthi has competed along with able-bodied athletes in the junior as well as senior championships.

She has won several medals at the junior level while competing alongside able-bodied athletes.

She last competed in an able-bodied senior event at the 2022 National Inter-State Championships in Chennai where she ran the 100m and 200m.

Before that, she competed with able-bodied athletes during the 2021 National Senior Inter-State Championships in Patiala and won the 200m bronze.

She won the 200m bronze in the 2019 Asian U18 Championships (able-bodied) with a time of 24.78 seconds.

Earlier in the day, Bhagyashri Jadhav finished fifth in the women's shot put (F34). Jadhav, making her second appearance at the Paralympics, produced a throw of 7.28m but it was not enough for a podium finish.

China's Lijuan Zou won the gold with a season best of 9.14m while Poland's Lucyna Kornobys secured the silver with an effort of 8.33m.

The 39-year-old from Nanded district in Maharashtra was one of the flag-bearers of the Indian contingent at the opening ceremony.

Athletes in the F34 class have to deal with co-ordination impairments including hypertonia (stiff muscles), ataxia (poor muscle control) and athetosis (slow, writhing movement of the limbs or trunk).","

Bangladesh remain in turmoil, despite the recent takeover by a new government and hence the members of the ICC board meeting agreed that the country cannot host the upcoming Women's T20 World Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) agreed with ICC's decision to move the tournament to the UAE, although they will remain the official host of the event.

The Bangladesh government did make a final effort to through the United Nations (UN) to host the tournament, but only in vain as countries like Australia, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom had issued travel advisories to their citizens against travelling to Bangladesh.

""It is a shame not to be hosting the Women's T20 World Cup in Bangladesh as we know the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) would have staged a memorable event,"" ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said in a statement.

""I would like to thank the team at the BCB for exploring all avenues to try and enable the event to be hosted in Bangladesh, but travel advisories from the governments of a number of the participating teams meant that wasn't feasible. However, they will retain hosting rights. We look forward to taking an ICC global event to Bangladesh in the near future.

""I'd also like to thank the Emirates Cricket Board for stepping in to host on behalf of the BCB and Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe for their generous offers of support, and we look forward to seeing ICC global events in both of those countries in 2026.""

UAE to stage Women's T20 World Cup

Earlier this month, media reports indicated that India could emerge as one of the hosts for the Women's T20 World Cup amid the ICC assessing Bangladesh's conditions. However, last week, BCCI ""categorically said no"" to the ICC's offer, leaving UAE and Sri Lanka as possible alternatives.

""They [ICC] have asked us if we would conduct the World Cup. I have categorically said no,"" BCCI secretary Jay Shah told Times of India. ""We're in the monsoon and on top of that we will host the Women's ODI World Cup next year. I don't want to give any kind of signals that I want to hold consecutive World Cups.""

The Sangai Express,2024-10-17 00:00:00,MMTU urges Govt to repatriate immigrants,"By Our Staff Reporter
IMPHAL, Oct 17: The Meetei (Meitei) Tribe Union (MMTU) has urged the Government to identify and repatriate all the immigrants from the soil of Manipur at the earliest.
Highlighting that a five-member bench of the Supreme Court today passed a judgement stating that 1971 should be adopted as the cut off base year for identification of non-local people in Assam, the MMTU has asserted that it is time for Manipur to take a concrete decision on identification and repatriation of immigrants.
A statement issued by MMTU pointed out that Manipur is currently facing a serious threat to its demography on account of incessant influx of illegal immigrants.
The Manipur Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution on August 5, 2022 for implementation of NRC and adoption of 1961 as base year for identification of immigrants. The same resolution was endorsed by the State Assembly this year, it said.
For the past many decades, Manipur has been a preferred destination for immigrants from both foreign countries and other parts of India. As a result, the indigenous people’s political space, identity, culture and economy have come under serious threats, it pointed out.
The MMTU said that the biggest challenge is the incessant influx of Kuki-Zo illegal immigrants from Myanmar.
Manipur’s hill districts inhabited by Kuki-Zo people saw an alarming growth of 1556 new villages during the last 50 years. As many as 560 villages sprang up in Churachandpur alone.
Unofficial reports say that around 2700 new villages surfaced in the hill districts inhabited by Kuki-Zo people during the last 50 years, it said.
Although the Inner Line Permit System (ILPS) has been implemented in Manipur since 2020, it remains quite ineffective in checking immigration of non-local people, it lamented.
The Kuki-Zo illegal immigrants from Myanmar were not only enlisted in the voters’ list but also granted Scheduled Tribe status. They also hold Aadhaar cards as well as PAN cards.
Following enlistment of Kuki-Zo illegal immigrants from Myanmar, Churachandpur district has 1,42,732 voters while Kangpokpi has 1,03,563 voters.
The indigenous people of Manipur need to take serious note of this continuous growth of villages and population in Kuki-Zo inhabited areas, and act promptly, it said.
All the illegal immigrants must be identified and repatriated as per law at the earliest, it added.
"," 
The Meetei Tribe Union (MMTU) has called on the Manipur Government to identify and repatriate immigrants to protect the state’s demographic integrity. Following a recent Supreme Court ruling that sets 1971 as the cut-off year for identifying non-locals in Assam, MMTU urged Manipur to establish similar measures. Citing a 2022 Manipur Legislative Assembly resolution to implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) with 1961 as the base year, MMTU emphasized the urgency of addressing demographic changes caused by immigrants. MMTU highlighted the influx of Kuki-Zo immigrants from Myanmar, noting a rapid rise in villages and voters, and stressed that Manipur's Inner Line Permit System has been ineffective in curbing immigration.

The Tribune,2024-12-31 00:00:00,"Cong slams Maharashtra minister for remarks against Kerala, seeks removal ","Congress general secretary K C Venugopal on Tuesday hit out at BJP leader and Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane for calling Kerala a “mini Pakistan” and said it shows their “deep-rooted animosity” for people of the southern state.

He also demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should immediately sack Rane for making such “shameful” remarks.

“From time to time, the BJP deploys its hatemongers to spew venom against Kerala. Using terms like ‘Mini Pakistan’ shows they have deep-rooted animosity for the people of Kerala,” Venugopal said in a post on X.The Congress leader said, for the entire world, Kerala is a model state that has continuously topped the human development indices, especially on education, healthcare and overall standard of living. Since millennia, Kerala has been a beacon of communal harmony and brotherhood among all religions and sects, he added.

“To use abusive language for the land of Sree Narayana Guru, Chattambi Swamikal and Mahatma Ayyankali, who advocated for egalitarianism, inclusivity and social justice, shows the BJP’s disregard for its own fellow citizens. ""If PM Modi has any shame about Mr. Rane’s statements, he should sack him immediately,” the Congress general secretary said. 

“The people of Kerala have rejected, and will never accept the BJP for this very reason - they do not understand the beauty of its harmonious living,” Venugopal added.

Maharashtra minister Rane sparked a major controversy by calling Kerala a “mini Pakistan” and stating “all terrorists vote for Gandhis”, a reference to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad.

Speaking at a rally in Purandar tehsil of Pune district on Sunday, the BJP minister said, “Kerala is mini Pakistan. Terrorists (earlier) voted for Rahul Gandhi and now for his sister Priyanka Gandhi.” Facing sharp criticism from opposition parties for his comments, Rane on Monday said Kerala is very much part of India and he is merely raising issues of religious conversion of Hindus and “love jihad” in the southern state.

Rahul Gandhi had won from the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala in 2019 and again in 2024 along with Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh. He retained Rae Bareli seat and vacated Wayanad, which was won by Priyanka Gandhi in a bye-election last month.","Congress leader K.C. Venugopal condemned Maharashtra BJP minister Nitesh Rane for labeling Kerala a ""mini Pakistan"" and demanded his immediate dismissal by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He called Rane’s remarks an insult to Kerala’s legacy of inclusivity and social justice, represented by figures like Sree Narayana Guru and Mahatma Ayyankali. Rane’s controversial statement also included claims linking terrorists to Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi.

The advent of this futuristic technology will benefit India in a big way, firing the engines of public service delivery, at scale and lower cost, she observed.

“AI is like any other tool, you can use it for good purposes, or you can use it for bad. So one needs to be careful. I am not scared but I would definitely recommend caution…I would recommend that we are careful about what we do with AI, and how we do it,” she said.

“I think there need to be a Global Compact on this as well. This is not something that is going to remain enclosed within borders of a country, it will impact people globally…AI is not going to be a respecter of borders of a country,” he said.

AI, at this point, is largely self-regulated, she noted.

“AI will need a global compact, it will need people to agree that there are possible ways that AI can be used that would be harmful to mankind…They would need to come together and have some kind of understanding to ensure that we use this tool for betterment of mankind…,” Bhattacharya said.

Bhattacharya smashed the glass ceiling in 2013 when she became the first woman to lead State Bank of India (SBI) in the bank’s over 200-year history. She retired from SBI in 2017 and went on to reinvent herself with a brand new career innings at the helm of cloud-based service provider Salesforce India in 2020, as Chairperson and CEO – a position she has held since.

Describing the advent of AI as a “gamechanger” and “blessing” for India, Bhattacharya said she is convinced that the technology will bring transformation all across, benefiting society.

“India does not have paucity of manpower, what it needs is technology for us to enable each of those people to reach optimum potential. To do that through brick-and mortar is difficult in terms of bandwidth and costs…if AI can deliver the first layer of it, and offer us insights to determine what exactly is needed, it will ensure fair distribution…it will be a great step forward,” she said.

It is pertinent to mention that while immense potential of AI to positively impact society has been widely-recognised by policymakers across the world, the potential dangers and risks around the new technology are also driving global conversations and parleys around need for safety brakes, and responsible, human-centric governance framework for Artificial Intelligence.","Arundhati Bhattacharya, CEO and Chairperson of Salesforce India, has called for a ""Global Compact"" on artificial intelligence (AI) to ensure its benefits are accessible to all and to prevent misuse. Bhattacharya believes that AI will be a ""game-changer"" for India's public services, with applications in healthcare, education, and skilling. However, she also warns of the potential harm if AI falls into the wrong hands, advocating for caution and responsible use. Like climate issues, AI crosses borders and requires international collaboration and consensus to regulate its use effectively. Bhattacharya suggests that a Global Compact on AI is necessary, as the technology affects people globally and is not limited by national borders. She emphasizes the need for understanding and agreement on using AI for the betterment of humanity. Bhattacharya, who broke barriers as the first woman to lead the State Bank of India, sees AI as a tool to enable India's vast workforce and ensure fair distribution of opportunities. However, she acknowledges the need for safety measures and responsible governance to address the risks associated with AI.",Technology and Gadgets,175,562
livemint,2024-09-17 00:00:00,When will business books focus more on corporate failures than successes?,"Every time I visit a bookstore, I make a point to check the business section. I’m always on the lookout for books by management gurus explaining why companies with certain characteristics succeed, why a particular company thrived, or how an individual played a significant role in that success. There are many such books in almost every bookstore, which suggests they have a significant readership.

However, I rarely come across books which explain why companies fail, given that most companies fail and many large companies falter and eventually even fail. The economist John Kay makes this point in his new book, The Corporation in the 21st Century. He points out that the business magazine Fortune started to rank the largest US companies in 1955 and has done so every year since.

The only company to be in the top 10 in 1955 and 2020 was ExxonMobil. As Kay writes: “Standard Oil of New Jersey [on the 1955 list] acquired its rival Mobil and is now ExxonMobil, the only business to appear in both 1955 and 2020.""

Also read: The best business books tend to be about music and sports

So, there has been a huge churn in the top 10 US companies over the past seven decades. And this isn’t because industries are stagnating or declining. As Kay writes: “Global demand for automobiles, food, oil, steel, chemical products and particularly electrical goods has continued to grow. Consumers still shop. But none of [the] 1955 companies is today the dominant firm in its industry.""

Closer home, many of the family-owned business groups that ran some of India’s biggest companies in the 1980s and even the 1990s are shadows of their former selves. More recently, the much hyped Byju’s and Paytm have struggled.

But management gurus, encouraged by commissioning editors salivating over sales prospects, continue to write on what makes companies and their leaders successful in the hope that these learnings could be used by others.

There is a formula to write such books. Cass Sunstein explains this in How To Become Famous: “Countless successful business books… try to figure out what characteristics are shared by inventors, innovators, leaders, or other successful types. If they find a shared characteristic, they urge that they have discovered a secret or clue of some kind."" But in their need to tell a compelling story, some gurus often forget a simple point: facts are not data.

What does that mean? Sunstein offers the example of Jim Collins’ superhit book, Good to Great. One characteristic of successful companies is a “culture of discipline,"" writes Collins.

To this, Sunstein points out that hundreds of companies can fail despite having a culture of discipline. In contrast, you could also find successful companies that lack such a culture.

Indeed, the idea behind almost all such books is to tell a good story with a flowing narrative that engages readers. As Alex Edmans writes in May Contain Lies: “Most books… only ever consider a selected sample that fits the story, so even if all their facts are correct, they’re inconclusive… [They] reverse-engineer an explanation… without ever testing whether other companies with the same traits had similar outcomes.""

Of course, this narrative is built on what Phil Rosenzweig calls a delusion of rigorous research in his wonderful book The Halo Effect. The trouble is that what’s claimed to be rigorous research is limited to studying characteristics of companies and individuals who are successful at the point of time the book is written, and does not cover others who might currently share or might have shared similar characteristics. Which is why many companies and individuals who are the subjects of such books eventually fizzle out.

So, this leaves us with an important question: Why do such books keep getting written? An explanation for their popularity lies in the fact that the human mind does not handle complexity well. Explanations for any success are complex but we want simple linear stories. As Rosenzweig puts it: “We prefer explanations that are definitive and offer clear implications.""

Also, people who believe they can easily understand the past are likely to assume they can predict the future as well. As Daniel Kahneman writes in Thinking, Fast and Slow: “The illusion that one has understood the past feeds the further illusion that one can predict and control the future. These illusions are comforting. They reduce the anxiety that we would experience if we allowed ourselves to fully acknowledge uncertainties of existence... Many business books are tailor-made to satisfy this need."" Indeed, the huge market for self-help books also thrives for this reason.

A huge market for such books is being monetized, but it would be nice if management gurus would also write a few books on why companies fail. Now that would add real value.

If not that, they should at least add a disclaimer to their books along the lines of what Kay suggests: “A journalist impressed by the strength of the FAANG corporations today [originally, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, with Netflix later replaced by Nvidia] once asked me if there were historic examples of once dominant companies which had lost that dominance. I told her the more interesting question was to find a historically dominant company that had retained that dominance."""," Management gurus often write books on what makes companies and leaders successful in the hope that these learnings could be used by others. The idea behind almost all such books is to tell a good story with a flowing narrative that engages readers.

The press conference also marked the formal induction of Ravi Raja, a five-term corporator in the Mumbai civic body, into the BJP. Raja, who departed from Congress after being denied an Assembly ticket from Sion-Koliwada, was immediately appointed as the party's vice president.""I served the party for 44 years, but Congress failed to utilise my experience and knowledge for the good of the party"", Raja said of his former political home.

The Arunachal Times,2024-08-03 00:00:00,"12-yr-old boy abducted, killed; 2 arrested","ITANAGAR, 2 Aug: A 12-year-old boy was recently abducted while he was returning home from school in Gohaingaon in Lohit district, and eventually killed.

Lohit SP Tumme Amo informed that the incident occurred on 22 July, when the boy was returning home from the school in Gohaingaon when two persons, identified as Najuso Tamai (32) and Govinda Tamang (28), abducted him from Gohaingaon area, and later killed him.

However, the Lohit police came to know about the incident only on 24 July, when the boy’s father, who works as a cattle caretaker, received a ransom call from an unknown number, demanding Rs 15 lakhs to release the boy.

“The boy’s father did not lodge an FIR out of fear that his son would be killed if he involved the police,” Amo informed.

“I came to know about the ransom call, made from mobile phone number 8131019161, from a local source. Though the victim’s father did not officially lodge a complaint, we swiftly constituted a 10-member team to track the caller,” the SP said.

The police traced the owner of the SIM card – a 15-year-old boy who works as a handyman. He was not using his SIM card; it was being used by his relatives.

“On being tracked by the police, the relatives of the SIM card’s owner revealed that a youth had snatched their mobile phone on 24 July,” the SP said.

He informed that the outgoing facility of the SIM card had expired, which compelled Tamai to insert his own SIM card to call the victim’s father.

The police found out from the card detail record (CDR) that one Tamai had called the victim’s father, and later, with information obtained from Facebook, the police identified Tamai and picked him up on the same night.

The SP informed that Tamai revealed during interrogation that his friend Govinda Tamang, a resident of Medo village, was using his mobile phone. The police later picked up Tamang from Medo village to corroborate the lead.

The police said that the ransom calls were made in Assamese, but the duo acted as if they didn’t know Assamese, which led to the police forcing them to repeat the same words that the ransom callers had used. Their recorded voices were played for the victim’s father, who recognised the voices.

Tamang and Tamai later confessed that they had abducted and killed the boy on 22 July because the boy had recognised Tamai’s face when they were making the ransom calls.

The police further informed that Tamai was the mastermind behind the plan to abduct the boy for ransom, in order to pay his debt. He had lured Tamang to join him in the crime.

A case [u/s 137/140(2)(3) BNS] has been registered at the Tezu police station, and the section dealing with murder will be added, the police said, and informed that the matter is still under investigation.

The SP expressed regret over not being able to save the boy as the police received the information two days after the abduction. He appealed to the people of Tezu to cooperate with the police to ensure that exemplary punishment is awarded to the accused.","A 12-year-old boy was abducted and killed by Najuso Tamai and Govinda Tamang in Lohit district, India.

Indian Express,2024-12-12 00:00:00,Today in Politics: SC to hear pleas on provisions of Places of Worship Act,"On Thursday, a Supreme Court special Bench will hear a clutch of pending petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991. This comes at a time when suits seeking surveys of mosques and dargahs have rekindled a debate across the country.

The special bench comprises Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna and Justices Sanjay Kumar and K V Viswanathan.



The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 mandates that the nature of all places of worship, except the one in Ayodhya that was then under litigation, shall be maintained as it was on August 15, 1947.

The Act, brought in by the P V Narasimha Rao-led Congress government during the height of the Ram temple movement, was also meant to apply to the disputed Kashi Vishwanath temple-Gyanvapi mosque complex in Varanasi and the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple-Shahi Idgah mosque complex in Mathura.

The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 mandates that the nature of all places of worship, except the one in Ayodhya that was then under litigation, shall be maintained as it was on August 15, 1947. The Act, brought in by the P V Narasimha Rao-led Congress government during the height of the Ram temple movement, was also meant to apply to the disputed Kashi Vishwanath temple-Gyanvapi mosque complex in Varanasi and the Krishna Janmabhoomi temple-Shahi Idgah mosque complex in Mathura.

Several petitions have challenged the Act, saying it bars the remedy of judicial review which the Supreme Court, in its 1980 judgment in Minerva Mills Ltd. & Ors vs Union Of India & Ors, said was a basic feature of the Constitution and, therefore, outside the legislative competence of Parliament. The Act, the petitioners have said, also violates the principle of secularism.

Hindu groups have been demanding that the Act be scrapped. The government is yet to take a stand on the issue before the court despite being issued notice more than three years ago.

In context: In June 2020, a Lucknow-based trust, Vishwa Bhadra Pujari Purohit Mahasangh, had moved the Supreme Court, challenging the Act. A few days later, the Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind, too, approached the court, seeking permission to be made a party in the matter. The Jamiat told the court that “even issuance of notice in the… matter will create fear in the minds of the Muslim community with regard to their places of worship, especially in the aftermath of the Ayodhya dispute and will destroy the secular fabric of the nation”. Subsequently, a few more petitions were filed in the matter, including one by a representative of the erstwhile royal family of Kashi. The court said it did not want to multiply the number of writ petitions on the same issue and asked the parties to instead file intervention applications.

Opposing these petitions, the management committee of the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi too has filed an intervention application, saying the “consequences” of allowing such pleas “are bound to be drastic”.

The mosque committee pointed to the violence in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh, where a court permitted the survey of the Shahi Jama Masjid by allowing an application for the appointment of a survey commissioner the very day the suit was presented.

the orissa post,2024-07-22 00:00:00,Paytm Apr-Jun quarter loss widens to Rs 840 crore,"The consolidated revenue of Paytm declined 33.48 per cent to Rs 1,639.1 crore during the reported quarter, from Rs 2,464.2 crore in the same period a year ago.

Paytm spokesperson attributed the widening of loss and decline in revenue primarily to the disruption in business due to restrictions imposed on associate company Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

“There were three factors which have led to this (decline in revenue and widening of loss) which are primarily disruption on account of PPBL products like Wallet. We stopped using Wallet and some of the products,” the spokesperson said.

The company also temporarily stopped some of the products on which regulators may have concern at an industry-level.

“We temporarily stopped a lot of those products and those products are in the process of starting. The third (factor) is that because of the disruption, our merchant base and GMV (gross merchandise value) came down and that has an impact on the profitability overall,” the spokesperson said.

Paytm’s GMV declined by 9.1 per cent from Rs 4.69 lakh crore on a quarter-on-quarter basis.

On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, however, Paytm reported GMV of Rs 4.3 lakh crore, up 5 per cent in the reported quarter.

The GMV from continued business recorded a 27 per cent jump on YoY basis to Rs 4.26 lakh crore, from Rs 3.36 lakh crore, despite a 15 per cent decline in monthly transacting users on a YoY basis to 7.8 crore. `

According to the spokesperson, the first quarter has absorbed the impact of PPBL disruption and the performance of companies will take off from the second quarter onwards.

The spokesperson said that there is now improvement in the company’s operating matrix including GMV, device merchant, recovery in loan distribution business as well as cost optimization.

“We are going to be very sharp in terms of cost optimisation. We have communicated that the employee cost has reduced by 9 per cent quarter-on-quarter in line with what we have said in last quarter.

“There were certain one-time items in this quarter that will come down sharply in the next quarter. The combination of these factors will lead to financial improvement,” the spokesperson said.

The employee benefit cost declined to Rs 798.4 crore, from Rs 970 crore on a year-over-year basis and from Rs 966 crore in March 2024 quarter.

Paytm reported a 5 per cent increase in average number of sales employees on YoY basis to 31,607 in the reported quarter, compared to 28,479 in June 2023 quarter. The number, however, declined by 13 per cent on a quarter-on-quarter basis.","Paytm's consolidated revenue fell 33.48% to ₹1,639.1 crore for the reported quarter, down from ₹2,464.2 crore a year ago. The decline was attributed to disruptions caused by restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which led to the suspension of some products like Wallet.

The company's GMV decreased by 9.1% quarter-on-quarter but saw a 5% year-on-year increase, reaching ₹4.3 lakh crore. GMV from continued business rose 27% year-on-year to ₹4.26 lakh crore, despite a 15% drop in monthly transacting users to 7.8 crore.

Paytm expects recovery starting from the second quarter, citing improvements in GMV, merchant base, loan distribution, and cost optimization. The company reduced employee costs by 9% quarter-on-quarter, with a decrease in overall employee benefit costs from ₹970 crore to ₹798.4 crore year-on-year. The average number of sales employees increased by 5% year-on-year but declined 13% quarter-on-quarter.

Hindustan Times,2025-01-02 00:00:00,"Rohit, Gambhir avoid talking to each other; India captain seeks comfort in Bumrah and Agarkar, looks clueless in nets","Things look down and out for Rohit Sharma, who, going by the visuals at the SCG on Thursday, did not speak to Gautam Gambhir even once during India's practice. How the mighty have fallen. About seven months ago, Rohit Sharma had become the toast of the nation when he ended India's agonisingly long wait for a World Cup win. Rewind to 19 November 2023, and the whole country shed a tear watching Rohit struggle to hold back his after Australia beat India in the final of the ODI World Cup at home. From that emotional evening in Ahmedabad, for Rohit to have made one final push in a format that many believed he was washed up and lift the trophy took a remarkable effort. In the process, he changed his game entirely. At 36, Rohit introduced a brand-new attacking form of batting to the world that he, Indian cricket and its fans began to enjoy. But as they say, all good things have to come to an end. Two days into the new year, Rohit finds himself isolated, literally and figuratively. For the last two months, he has looked at sixes and sevens, struggling for form, and with runs hard to come by, for the first time in history, as long as the memory can serve right, an Indian captain is going to be dropped from the Playing XI, let alone in a Test match carrying the magnitude of a series as big as the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. 'Rest' may be nothing more than a word designed to sugar-coat that Rohit Sharma, captain of the Indian team, does not deserve a place in India's Test XI. When India's head coach, Gautam Gambhir, refused to answer Rohit's participation in the Playing XI, it was all the confirmation the world needed. And if that wasn't enough, the growing distance and tension between the captain and coach underlines it all too well. As per a report in the PTI, Rohit and Gambhir were not on talking terms the entire match eve, with each individual on the other side of the ground. When two chairs were placed for India's pre-match press conference, it was assumed that Rohit and Gambhir might finally address a PC together since, something Rohit and Rahul Dravid often did – but alas! Once again, it was only one of the two. However, India's selection drama reached a fever pitch when Rohit and Gambhir avoided talking to each other.
""It was around half past one when Gautam Gambhir walked towards the centre strip at the Sydney Cricket Ground with Jasprit Bumrah in tow. A few minutes later, Rohit Sharma also joined the duo in the middle but there was hardly any communication between the head coach and the designated captain,"" the PTI report stated.

""All present at the SCG witnessed a complete communication breakdown between skipper and the head coach. There were already enough indications but the developments on Thursday made one thing as clear as daylight. Rohit Sharma is no longer in coach Gautam Gambhir’s scheme of things after scoring just one second innings half-century in the eight Tests he has played this season.""

Rohit turns to Jasprit Bumrah and Ajit Agarkar
Clearly pained by all that's happened with and around him, Rohit found solace in vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah and chairman of the BCCI selection committee Ajit Agarkar. Such was the equation between the captain and the coach. Rohit and even Gambhir, as a matter of fact, have time and again insisted that both share a good camaraderie and that ever since the coach took over, they are on the same page. But with the recent string of developments, such as India's performances in Tests and the heated dressing room discussions that got leaked, things are clearly otherwise and are heading down south. Rohit was lost one day before the start of the series decider against Australia. He came out almost 35 minutes after the main batters and wasn't carrying his kit. In a sweatshirt, Rohit took strike, but what unfolded then was a heartbreaking sight. For the next 30-odd minutes that he practiced, Rohit was all over the place. He missed straight deliveries, which hit his stumps. For someone like Rohit, who made a career out of having a second extra, the sight of him struggling to get the bat down on time against T Dilip's throwdown was excruciatingly painful.

""Once Rohit was done with his training, he along with Bumrah and Agarkar left the nets but Gambhir stayed back. It is learnt that during this meeting after training it was decided that Rohit Sharma would be 'rested', which in Indian cricket parlance means 'dropped by intimation',"" the report added.



","Rohit Sharma’s form and position in India’s Test XI have hit a low, with visuals at SCG on Thursday showing a communication breakdown with coach Gautam Gambhir.

The Economic Times,2025-01-03 00:00:00,"Reality of Gurgaon life: Work hard and give it all to landlord as rent, says netizen","A Reddit user recently shared a video showcasing the contrasting realities of life in Gurugram. While the video highlights the gleaming
cybercity with its tech hubs and metro accessibility, it also reveals the less glamorous side—the worn-down residential areas where many
corporate workers reside. The post sparked discussions on the high cost of living in the city, with many commenting on the steep rent
hikes and the difficulty of affording decent housing. 
Gurgaon aka Gurugram, often referred to as a corporate hub and a symbol of modern urban living, presents a stark
contrast between its glitzy tech offices and the challenges faced by those living in its neighborhoods. A recent Reddit post
has gone viral, shedding light on this disparity, with one netizen sharing a video, offering a glimpse into the dual nature
of life in the city, which is known for its thriving corporate sector.
The video shared on Reddit, begins with a shot of Gurugram’s cybercity, showcasing sleek tech office buildings and the
metro that connects the city to various parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) — all symbols of Gurugram’s image as
a fast-paced, global business city.
However, as the camera shifts, it reveals the other side of Gurugram – the U Block, where many corporate workers live.The area is described as dusty, crowded, and characterized by old, rusted houses
The Reddit post and its comments reflect the growing dissatisfaction among residents of the city who are grappling with
rising living costs and substandard housing conditions.
One user commented on the poor quality of life in U-block, recalling their own experience in 2011:
""Dusty and crowded.
""
Other comments echoed similar sentiments, pointing to the growing inequality between the corporate hub and its
residential areas. The Rent Dilemma: A Struggle for Many
Alongside the video, discussions on Reddit have echoed the frustrations of people dealing with the high cost of living in
Gurugram. One Reddit user, in a post titled “Need help..!! When did the rentals become so high in Gurgaon, and why??”
,
highlighted the surge in rental prices. The user, who recently moved back to Delhi NCR from Bangalore, was taken aback
by how much more expensive rents had become in the city, especially compared to his previous experiences.
“When did
rentals get so high here? I remember being in GGN pre-COVID and it was very normal,
” he said. According to a report from Magicbricks, rent prices across 13 major Indian cities, including Gurugram, have surged by an
alarming 16% year-on-year as of the March 2024 quarter. Gurugram’s rental prices have risen by 24.5%, closely following
Bengaluru’s 23.7% increase. A key driver for this sharp rise has been the resurgence of office operations following the
pandemic, leading to increased demand for rental properties in cities with strong IT and corporate sectors.
“We’ve
witnessed a notable surge in rental demand, consequently driving up rents and offering higher yields to landlords,
”
explained Abhishek Bhadra, Head of Research at Magicbricks.
Many Reddit users have expressed their frustration with the situation. One user pointed out the disparity between the
high rents and the city’s infrastructure, suggesting that Gurugram residents are paying a premium for subpar living
conditions, particularly when it comes to air quality, sewage problems, and general urban mismanagement.
“We pay so
much to live in such crappy conditions. We are idiots,
” the user lamented.
The Price of Corporate Living
Despite the challenges, Gurugram continues to attract professionals, particularly those in the tech and corporate sectors.
It remains home to several multinational companies and is a hub for young professionals looking to make it in India’s
booming business environment. The city’s promise of modern amenities, well-maintained infrastructure, and proximity
to workplaces makes it an attractive option. However, the reality of high rents and crowded living conditions is pushing
many to question whether the price of living in such an urbanized environment is truly worth it.
One user shared their experience of trying to find a 3BHK apartment in Gurugram, noting that rent prices on popular
roads like Golf Course Road had shot up significantly.
“Gurgaon was always costlier than Bangalore, but now the prices
and rentals have more than doubled here in the last two years,
” said another Reddit user, sharing their frustration over
the skyrocketing costs. The post highlighted how the demand for affordable housing in Gurugram continues to outpace
the available supply.
Is Gurugram’s Rental Market Sustainable?
The soaring rental prices in Gurugram reflect a broader trend that is being observed across many Indian cities. With high
demand and limited supply, especially in tech hubs and corporate centers, prices continue to climb. However, experts
believe that this trend may not be sustainable for long. As rental prices keep rising, both landlords and tenants may have
to adjust to the shifting dynamics of the market.
According to the Magicbricks report, the rental surge is expected to continue, particularly in areas with strong IT
presence like Bengaluru, Gurugram, and Hyderabad. But as demand continues to outstrip supply, there are growing
concerns about affordability and the quality of life for many city dwellers.
The conversation on Reddit highlights an important issue that many Gurugram residents face daily. While the city’s
modern appeal attracts workers from across the country, the high cost of living is leaving many struggling to keep up with
rental demands. As one Reddit user aptly put it,
“We are working hard, but all we’re doing is giving it all to the landlord as
rent.
”
The disparity between Gurugram’s polished corporate image and the lived experiences of its residents is becoming more
evident, and the rising rent prices only exacerbate the situation. As the city continues to grow, finding a balance between
development, affordability, and quality of life will be key to sustaining its appeal as a corporate and tech hub.","Gurugram, often seen as a modern corporate hub, is grappling with stark contrasts between its gleaming cybercity and deteriorating residential areas like U-Block. A viral Reddit video highlights this disparity, showcasing sleek office spaces and metro accessibility alongside dusty, crowded neighborhoods where many corporate workers reside.

Reports indicate Gurugram’s rents have surged by 24.5% year-on-year, driven by increased demand post-pandemic. Many residents struggle with affordability, pointing to poor air quality, sewage issues, and urban mismanagement. Professionals continue to flock to the city for its proximity to workplaces and modern amenities, but soaring rents are forcing questions about the sustainability of this trend. 

As demand outpaces supply, experts warn of the need for balanced development, addressing affordability and quality of life to maintain Gurugram’s status as a corporate and tech hub.",Local News,146,970

Amid constant speculation of his future and place in the Indian Test team, following a dwindling return with the bat since September, captain Rohit Sharma reportedly 'opted out' of the playing XI on the eve of the fifth and final Test match against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series. Rohit, who managed just 31 runs in the series to record the worst average (6.20) by a touring skipper in Australia, will be replaced by Shubman Gill, while KL Rahul will be expected to open in Sydney.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Pak minister sees Mumbai resemblance in Lahore attack,"The attack in Lahore,where a group of armed gunmen took policemen at a training school hostage,bears resemblance to the Mumbai terror attacks,Pakistan Interior Ministry chief Rehman Malik said on Monday.

“This attack is similar to the Mumbai attacks. We do not know who has done it and cannot be sure until we arrest any culprit and investigate further,” Malik said.

“This is not an ordinary attack,it is an attack on Pakistan’s integrity,” he said.

The Minister said there were intelligence reports on March 15-16,when the lawyers’ “Long March’ was on,that the country could witness terror attacks and the provincial governments were asked to beef up security.

“There was information on March 15-16. We were told some Uzbeks and terrorists had held a meeting and had decided to dispatch attackers to different parts of the country.

“Provincial governments were thereby informed and asked to take preventive measures,” he told Dawn News.

At least 20 policemen,including eight officers,have been killed and 70 others injured when a group of heavily armed terrorists stormed a police training centre near the Wagah border and took several hostages on Monday.

The terrorists believed to be around 14 in number targeted the centre on Monday morning,lobbing grenades and firing indiscriminately,before holing up inside the facility.

On the ongoing attack in Lahore,he said the best possible efforts are being made and top officials are present at the spot to tackle the crisis.

The New Indian Express,2024-09-03 00:00:00,"Sumit Antil wins gold in javelin throw F64, becomes first Indian man to defend title in Paralympics","PARIS: Star javelin thrower Sumit Antil on Monday became the first Indian man and second from the country to defend the title as he won the F64 category gold with Paralympics record of 70.59m at the Paris Games.

The 26-year-old world record holder from Sonipat in Haryana bettered his own earlier Paralympic best of 68.55m set in Tokyo while winning the gold three years ago.

Antil's world record stands at 73.29m.

Reigning world champion Antil is the second Indian overall after shooter Avani Lekhara to defend the Paralympics title.

Avani had won gold in women's 10m air rifle standing SH1 event in Paris after winning a yellow metal in the same event in Tokyo Games.

He also joined an exclusive three-member club of Indians who have won two Paralympics gold.

Besides Antil and Avani, the third member of the group is current Paralympic Committee of India President Devendra Jhajharia who won javelin throw F46 gold in 2004 Athens and 2016 Rio Games.

Antil has also won gold in the World Para Athletics Championships in 2023 and 2024, besides standing on top of podium in last year's Asian Para Games in Hangzhou, China.

The wrestler-turned-javelin thrower clinched India's third gold of the Paris Paralympics and first in para-athletics.

It was India's fifth medal from para-athletics here.

Antil destroyed the field with his second round throw of 70.59m.

He had two other big throws of 69.11m in his opening attempt and 69.04m in his fifth effort, both bettering his earlier Paralympic record.

Antil, though, could not breach the 75m mark, the target he had set before going to the Paris Games.

Dulan Kodithuwakku of Sri Lanka took the silver with 67.03m while Michal Burian of Australia won the bronze with a throw of 64.89m.

Two other Indians in the fray, Sandeep and Sandip Sanjay Sargar, finished fourth and seventh with throws of 62.80m and 58.03m respectively.

F64 category is for athletes with problems in the lower limb(s), those competing with prosthesis or affected by leg length difference.

Antil lost his left leg below the knee after he was involved in a motorbike accident in 2015.

A student of Delhi's Ramjas College, Antil was an able-bodied wrestler before his accident which led to amputation of his leg below the knee.

A para athlete in his village initiated him to the sport in 2018.

He even competed against Tokyo Olympics champion Neeraj Chopra in the able-bodied Indian Grand Prix series 3 on March 5, 2021 in Patiala.

He had finished seventh with a best throw of 66.43m while Chopra shattered his then national record with a big effort of 88.07m.

Earlier in the day, Yogesh Kathuniya clinched his second consecutive Paralympic silver medal in men's discus throw F-56 event with a season's best effort 42.22m.

The 27-year-old hurled the discus to the podium-clinching distance in his very first attempt to add to the silver he won in Tokyo.

Brazil's Claudiney Batista dos Santos registered a hat-trick of Paralympic gold medals, creating a new Games record with an effort of 46.86m in his fifth attempt.

Greece's Konstantinos Tzounis won the bronze with 41.32m.

The F-56 classification covers limb deficiency, leg length difference, impaired muscle power and impaired range of movement.

At the age of 9, Kathuniya developed the Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare autoimmune condition which causes numbness, tingling and muscle weakness that can progress to paralysis.

He was bound to the wheelchair during his childhood but overcame the odds with the help of his mother Meena Devi, who learnt physiotherapy to help him regain muscle strength to walk again.

His father has served in the Indian Army.

Kathuniya is a commerce graduate from Delhi's prestigious Kirori Mal College.

Besides two Paralympic silver medals, he has three world championship medals, including two silver and a bronze.

On Sunday, Preethi Pal created history as she became the first Indian woman track and field athlete to win two medals at the Paralympics while Nishad Kumar clinched his second successive silver at the showpiece in the men's high jump T47 category.

The 23-year-old Preethi bagged a bronze in the 200m T35 category with a personal best time of 30.01 seconds.

She also won a bronze in the 100m T35 category on Friday.

She also became only the second Indian woman to win two medals -- both bronze -- in a single Paralympics after shooter Avani Lekhara who won a gold and a bronze in Tokyo three years ago.

A farmer's daughter from Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh, Preethi faced significant physical challenges when she was born as her lower body was plastered for six days after birth.

Weak legs and an irregular leg posture made her prone to various diseases.

She underwent various traditional treatments to strengthen her legs, including wearing calipers for eight years from the age of five.

T35 classification is meant for athletes who have coordination impairments such as hypertonia, ataxia and athetosis.

The 24-year-old Nishad, who hails from Una in Himachal Pradesh, won India's third medal from para-athletics and seventh overall for the country in Paris Paralympics with a season's best effort of 2.04m.

Nishad lost his right hand in a grass-cutting machine accident when he was six-year-old.

Nishad had also won a silver in Tokyo Paralympics three years ago with a jump of 2.06m.","

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) declared a holiday for the day for all the civic, government and private schools and colleges in the city to avoid inconvenience to students.

""The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in Mumbai. Additionally, at 1.57 pm today, there will be a 4.40 m high tide in the sea,"" a BMC spokesperson said.

Swapnil Nila, chief public relations officer of the Central Railway (CR), said train services on the fast line of the main corridor between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) in south Mumbai and neighbouring Thane were suspended due to waterlogging at various places.

Suburban services were running on the slow line, he said.

The Harbour corridor services were also temporarily suspended due to waterlogging at Chunnabhati.

Commuters complained that the operational suburban services were running late. There was heavy rush of commuters at some of the key stations and in trains.

The CR officials said due to heavy rain and high tide in Mumbai, local train movement in the suburban section was affected and asked people to avoid travelling unless unavoidable.

The civic body said there will be a high tide of 4.40 meters in Mumbai at 1.57 pm, which coupled with heavy rains could lead to waterlogging in low lying areas.

The Western Railway said suburban trains were running up to 10 minutes late because water was above the track level between Matunga Road and Dadar due to heavy showers.

""High capacity water pumps are being utilised to drain water away from the railway tracks to ensure a smooth commute for Mumbaikars,"" a Western Railway spokesperson said.

Heavy rains and low visibility led to the suspension of runway operations at the Mumbai airport from 2.22 am to 3.40 am on Monday and 27 diversions were reported, sources said.

Flights were diverted to cities such as Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Indore, among others, they said.

Currently, priority is being given to arriving flights, the sources added.

A spokesperson of the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking said at least 40 bus routes in the city and suburbs were either diverted or curtailed due to waterlogging on roads at various locations.

The IMD issued a ""Nowcast"" warning at around 10.15 am, valid for three hours, predicting moderate spells of rainfall in the city and suburbs.

It forecast ""heavy rainfall at isolated places"" in the next 24 hours.

The BMC said some areas in Mumbai received more than 300 mm rainfall from 1 am to 7 am on Monday.

The civic body appealed to citizens not to believe in rumours and dial its control numbers for emergency help.

Municipal commissioner Bhushan Gagrani was at the disaster management control room and keeping a close eye on the situation, a civic spokesperson said.

There was no overflowing of the Poisar, Dahisar, and Oshiwara rivers in western Mumbai , he said.

BMC's disaster management control room was keeping an eye on all the happenings and all senior officials and ward level staffers are on the field, the civic body said.

In the 24-hour period ending at 8 am on Monday, the island city recorded an average 115.63 mm rainfall, while the eastern and western parts of Mumbai received 168.68 mm and 165.93 mm rain, respectively, an official said.

In eastern Mumbai, Govandi recorded the highest 315.6 mm rainfall, followed by 314.5 mm at Powai, while in western parts, Malpa Dongri in Andheri received the highest 292.2 mm rainfall followed by 278.2 mm at Chakala.

In the island city, Pratiksha Nagar got 220.2 mm rainfall, followed by 185.8 mm in Sewri Koliwada.

The telegraph,2024-07-15 00:00:00,Fly Me to the Moon: Scarlett Johansson-Channing Tatum's chemistry fuels this period film,"Fly Me To The Moon, the latest crowd-pleaser from director Greg Berlanti, takes audiences on a whimsical ride with Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, against the historical backdrop of the 1960s space race.

Johansson plays Kelly Jones, a quick-witted and ambitious advertising executive tasked with reigniting public interest in the Apollo 11 mission. With the Vietnam War raging and the Cold War in full swing, public enthusiasm for the space programme has dwindled. Kelly’s mission is to craft a campaign that will capture people’s minds, reminding everyone why reaching for the stars is important.

ADVERTISEMENT
Enter Cole Davis (Tatum), a dedicated but uptight launch director at Cape Canaveral. Cole is laser-focused on the technical aspects of the mission, leaving little room for the frivolous world of marketing. As Kelly and Cole clash and collaborate, the sparks fly but their budding romance is in constant threat of being derailed by the pressures of the impending rocket launch.

Johansson brings a crackling energy to Kelly, flashing her sharp wit and steely determination. Tatum sheds his typical action-hero persona to play the stoic Cole, and his comedic timing in his interactions with Kelly is delightful. While the romance plotline is predictable, their chemistry keeps you glued to their journey.

ADVERTISEMENT
Their witty banter provides many laugh-out-loud moments.

The supporting cast adds further depth to the story. Woody Harrelson is riveting as a ruthless government official with an agenda, injecting a dose of suspense into the narrative. Ray Romano, though underused, provides some heartwarming moments as a deputy director at NASA. Jim Rash (in what appears to be a nod to Stanley Kubrick) delivers a standout performance as a flamboyant yet frustrated filmmaker who finally gets to showcase his artistic talent, albeit in secret.

Fly Me To The Moon touches upon weightier themes too, like societal anxieties surrounding the space race, the pressure faced by astronauts and their families, and the sacrifices made in the pursuit of scientific progress. The film uses period details and cultural references to evoke a sense of nostalgia for the swinging sixties, but the tonal shifts can be jarring at times — from a retro romcom to a biting political satire and then to a heavy, reflective drama, only to swing back to comedy again.

The film’s climax is confusing in the lead-up to the question of what’s real versus what’s fake. It drags on a previous conclusion, over-explaining motivations and developments that would have been more compelling if left to the viewer’s imagination. At over two hours long, the final 30 minutes feel particularly drawn out.","""Fly Me To The Moon,"" directed by Greg Berlanti, stars Scarlett Johansson as an advertising executive and Channing Tatum as a launch director amid the 1960s space race. Their witty banter and budding romance drive the film, while supporting actors like Woody Harrelson and Ray Romano add depth. Despite some jarring tonal shifts, the movie captures nostalgic and weighty themes.

The Arunachal Times ,2024-07-22 00:00:00,India trade talks set to be revived with first major UK ministerial visit,"London, 21 Jul: The renewed parameters of the India-UK free trade agreement negotiations are set to be defined this week as UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is expected in India on Tuesday, the first high-profile visit under the newly elected Labour government in Britain.
The free trade agreement (FTA) talks began in January 2022, under the then Conservative government, with a target to significantly boost the GBP 38.1 billion a year bilateral trading partnership but hit a block in the fourteenth round of negotiations to make way for general elections in both countries.
A report in The Daily Telegraph on Sunday quotes a New Delhi source to claim the Indian side would seek clarity on whether the Labour government intends to pick things up from where they were left off or start afresh in some way.
“India is keen to resume talks on a positive note, but the date needs clarity,” the source told the newspaper.
“The trade deal was at the final stage in the previous government, and we want to see whether the Labour government wants to start from where we left it in March before the elections or start afresh from scratch. Our stance on visas for professionals remains unchanged. We are expecting a positive outcome under the Labour government,” the source added.
During his last major intervention on India-UK relations just days before Labour’s landslide electoral victory earlier this month, Lammy told India Global Forum (IGF) in London that he intends to get the deal done as soon as possible.
“My message to [Finance] Minister [Nirmala] Sitharaman and [Trade] Minister [Piyush] Goyal is that Labour is ready to go. Let’s finally get our free trade deal done and move on,” he said, lamenting former prime minister Boris Johnson’s missed Diwali 2022 deadline.
“With Labour, the days of Boris Johnson reciting that old verse from Rudyard Kipling in Asia are over. If I recite a poem in India, it will be Tagore… because with a superpower like India, the areas of cooperation and the areas for learning are limitless,” he said.
On visas, which have been touted in the UK media as a major sticking point in the talks, High Commissioner Vikram Doraiswami clarified at the same summit that it is not the “priority” for India.
He explained: “What we’re trying to do with this free trade agreement is to increase the depth or the extent of ambition, including in goods and services, that we’d like to offer to the UK.” “Visas are not the first priority for us in an FTA. We are not looking at the FTA as a means to bring people to the UK, that is not the objective,” he said.
“What we’re looking for is whatever is reasonable within the broad framework of international trade and services under Mode 4 of GATS [General Agreement on Trade in Services of the World Trade Organisation] to be able to have persons travelled for intercompany transfers etc.,” he added.
The Prime Minister Keir Starmer-led Labour Party manifesto pledged to seek a “new strategic partnership with India, including a free trade agreement, as well as deepening cooperation in areas like security, education, technology and climate change”. (PTI)
Lammy’s expected visit to India next week, on his way to the 57th ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Meeting at Vientiane in Lao People’s Democratic Republic, is expected to set the tone for how this pledge is to be realised. (PTI)","UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is set to visit India this week to redefine the terms of the India-UK free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. Talks began in January 2022 but stalled during the general elections. India seeks clarity on whether the Labour government will continue from where the previous administration left off or start anew. While visas for professionals are not a priority for India, there is a focus on expanding trade in goods and services. Lammy’s visit aims to rejuvenate the FTA discussions, reflecting the Labour Party's commitment to strengthening the India-UK strategic partnership.",International News,95,570

Indian Express,2024-12-30 00:00:00,The ‘Rock and Roll’ president: Remembering Jimmy Carter’s connection to the world of music,"Former president Jimmy Carter passed away on 29 December. He was an influential leader and a towering figure in politics, but he had a special relationship with music.

The 39th US president was known for his love for music and how he insisted on the importance of music for social change and evolution. Much of this is also highlighted in the 2020 documentary named Jimmy Carter: Rock and Roll President. The Georgia native grew up in a time of segregation and was quite vocal about his position against the practice. He grew up around gospel music and emphasised that the genre was not limited to a certain race or class; rather, it was a medium to express one’s “pain and faith.”

In the documentary, Carter emphasised that music was a binding agent for America: “One of the things that has held America together has been the music that we share and love.” He used music and its biggest faces to provide his electorate a chance to relate to their leader. Jimmy Carter was close friends with artistes like Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, and the Allman Brothers.  “When I first met Jimmy, the first thing he did was quote my songs back to me,” said Dylan in the 2020 documentary.

Jimmy Carter was one of the leading names of the New South Movement. This post-Civil War movement was a call to bring about economic change in the South, to move from an agrarian economy to an industry-heavy one. During this same time, Carter’s home state of Georgia was pushing out one big name after the other, such as James Brown, Otis Redding, and Ray Charles. The Allman Brothers were aligned with Carter’s thoughts as being one of the first racially rock bands of the time.

“He was cool; he enjoyed our music, and he became a friend,” said Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers in the documentary. Carter was known to attend many of their shows and even introduced them on the stage a few times. His connection to the music of the time and the message it carried spoke to people. It added to his already prevalent ‘down to earth’ image, as many related with him due to his humble beginnings as a part of a small agrarian family.

Under Carter’s administration, many concerts and music festivals were held, featuring artistes like Dolly Parton, Charles Mingus, Herbie Hancock, Dizzy Gillespie and many more.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner emphasised that music is “proof that people have one thing in common, no matter where they live and what language they speak.” Carter passed away at the age of 100, making him the longest-living US president.","Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter passed away on December 29 at the age of 100.

The New Indian Express,2025-01-05 00:00:00,Washington Post cartoonist quits after satire on owner Jeff Bezos gets rejected,"The Washington Post newspaper’s cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, who is a Pulitzer Prize winning illustrator, has resigned from her position at the newspaper after one of her cartoons which was satirical of its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos was rejected.

In the cartoon, Telnaes drew Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, Jeff Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue, reportedly of President-elect Donald Trump.

Telnaes called the refusal by the paper to publish the cartoon as “game changer” and termed it as “dangerous for a free press”.

Telnaes, who has worked with the newspaper since 2008, drew Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and OpenAI’s Sam Altman kneeling before Trump’s statue. Along with them, a figure of cartoon character Mickey Mouse kneeling was also depicted.

Mickey Mouse probably referred to the ABC News, which is owned by Disney, and agreed to pay $15 million to Trump last month in a defamation suit filed by the president-elect against the news channel.

In a post on Substack, Telnaes wrote “I have had editorial feedback and productive conversations – and some differences – about cartoons I have submitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a cartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at.”

However, the Washington Post’s Opinion Editor David Shipley defended the paper’s decision to drop the cartoon and said that he disagreed with her “interpretation of events” and that “the only bias was against repetition”, reported The Guardian.

“My decision was guided by the fact that we had just published a column on the same topic as the cartoon and had already scheduled another column – this one a satire – for publication,” Shipley said.

Telnaes, a staff member since 2008, criticized the rejection as a “dangerous” precedent for free press. In a Substack post, she expressed concern over editorial interference, calling the decision a “game changer.”

The Pioneer,2024-09-03 00:00:00,World champion Sachin Khilari wins silver in men's shot put (F46) in Paralympics,"World champion Sachin Sarjerao Khilari clinched a silver in men's shot put F46 event with an Asian record distance of 16.32m as the country's track-and-field athletes continued their unprecedented medal-winning run in the Paralympic Games here on Wednesday.

The 34-year-old Khilari achieved his best throw of the day in his second attempt to better his own Asian record of 16.30m which he set while winning gold in the World Para-Athletics Championships in Japan in May.

However, the effort, which was also his personal best, was not enough for the top honour as Greg Stewart of Canada defended his Tokyo Paralympics gold with a throw of 16.38m. Luka Bakovic of Croatia took the bronze with 16.27m.

Khilari's silver is the 11th medal from para-athletics in the ongoing Games and took India's overall tally to 21, including three gold.

Stewart had finished second to Khilari in the World Para-Athletics Championships in Kobe in May, and the tables were turned at Stade de France on Wednesday.

F46 classification is for athletes with arm deficiency, impaired muscle power or impaired passive range of movement in arms, with athletes competing in a standing position.

""I had wanted to win the gold medal, but it did not happen. It's my best distance but I am not satisfied. I feel I could have done better. It was not my day,"" Khilari said after winning the silver medal.

""It was a tough competition and Greg Stewart is a great player. I made small mistakes in my technique. I will work harder and I hope to beat him next time.""

Late on Tuesday night, Indians won silver and bronze in both men's high jump T63 and javelin throw F46 after Deepthi Jeevanji's bronze in the women's 400m T20 category.

Sharad Kumar and Mariyappan Thangavelu won silver and bronze respectively in the men's high jump T63 while Ajeet Singh and Sundar Singh Gurjar took the second and third sports in the javelin throw F46 final.

On Wednesday, Khilari was leading at the end of the second round but Stewart surged ahead with his third throw of 16.34m before improving further in his fifth and penultimate attempt of 16.38m.

Other Indians in the fray, Mohd Yasser (14.21m) and Rohit Kumar (14.10m) finished eighth and ninth respectively.

American Joshua Cinnamo, who holds the world record of 16.80m, was fourth with 15.66m.

A mechanical engineering degree holder, Khilari, who had also won a gold in last year's Asian Para Games in China, has an impaired left hand.

Hailing from a farming family at Karagani village in Maharashtra's Sangli district, Khilari met with an accident during his school days. The injury resulted in gangrene of the skin on his elbow and muscle atrophy. Even after several surgeries, his arm never recovered.

He also lost his mother when he was young.

Despite all these setbacks, he took up javelin while he was studying to become an engineer. A shoulder injury during competition forced him to switch to shot put.

Khilari was introduced to para sports in 2015 and later met well-known coach Satayanarayana who supported him in improving his game.

He also worked as a visiting faculty member at various institutions, assisting students in their UPSC and Maharashtra Public Service examination preparations.

The previous best show by India's track and field contingent in a single Paralympics was in Tokyo when it won one gold, five silver and two bronze medals.

With 11 medals, including a gold from star javelin thrower Sumit Antil, the para athletes have bagged more than half of the country's total medals.

The number of gold is, however, set to be lower than what the officials had hoped to win this time.

","World champion Sachin Sarjerao Khilari secured a silver medal in the men’s shot put F46 event at the Paralympic Games with a new Asian record throw of 16.32m. Despite surpassing his previous record of 16.30m, Khilari fell short of gold as Canada's Greg Stewart won with 16.38m. Khilari's performance, which was also his personal best, contributed to India's impressive medal haul of 21, including three golds, with track-and-field athletes claiming 11 of these medals. Khilari, a mechanical engineer from Maharashtra, overcame personal and physical challenges to achieve this feat. Other Indian athletes also earned silver and bronze in various events, marking the country’s best track-and-field performance in Paralympics history.",Sports,109,610

For a nourishing and balanced breakfast, focus on incorporating a variety of nutrient-dense foods; include a mix of carbohydrates, fibre, protein, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals from grains (cereals, millets, pulses), fruits, vegetables, nuts and dairy.”

She revealed, “Breakfast cereals are made with a variety of grains, are naturally cholesterol-free, generally low in fat and provide nutrients like carbohydrates, protein and fibre. They are mostly enriched with key essential vitamins and minerals which perform several important functions in the body. Ready-to-eat cereals are best consumed with milk or yoghurt and fruits/dry fruits. It is important to use your imagination and creativity to make the breakfast experience for the kids tasty, colourful, and fun. Think of adding playful shapes, vibrant colours, and a variety of textures to keep them excited about their morning meal. This way, we cultivate a generation of breakfast eaters who look forward to starting their day with nutritious and enjoyable food.”","A nutritious breakfast is essential for refueling the body, replenishing glucose, enhancing nutrient intake, and promoting metabolic health.

DNA,2024-08-16 00:00:00,Former Thailand PM Thaksin Shinawatra’s daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra becomes country's youngest ever PM,"Thailand's Parliament on Friday voted for Paetongtarn Shinawatra to become the country's 31st Prime Minister, reported Channel News Asia. Paetongtarn, 37, the daughter of the country's billionaire tycoon and former Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra will succeed Srettha Thavisin, who was removed from office by the country's constitutional court on August 14 in an ethics case.

The country's Pheu Thai party on Thursday nominated Paetongtarn Shinawatra as prime minister candidate. Paetongtarn has become the fourth member of the Shinawatra family to become Thailand's prime minister, following Thaksin Shinawatra, Somchai Wongsawat (Thaksin's brother-in-law), and Yingluck Shinawatra, the Bangkok Post said.

As many as 319 MPs voted for Pheu Thai party leader Paetongtarn Shinawatra to become Thailand's new prime minister on Friday. 145 voted against and 27 abstained. Srettha, a real estate mogul, became the fourth Thai prime minister in the past 16 years to be ousted by the court, which found that he breached the constitution by choosing a minister who did not meet ethical standards. His dismissal, after less than a year in office, means that parliament will need to meet to select a new prime minister, raising the possibility of increased uncertainty in a country plagued by coups and judicial decisions that have repeatedly toppled governments and political parties over the past two decades.
Just last week, the same court dissolved the anti-establishment Move Forward Party (MFP), a popular opposition group, ruling that its efforts to reform a law against insulting the monarchy threatened the constitutional monarchy. The MFP reformed under a new name on Friday, CNA reported. Srettha's Pheu Thai Party, along with its predecessors, has been at the centre of Thailand's political turmoil, with two of its administrations removed by coups in an ongoing conflict between the party's founders, the Shinawatra family, and their conservative and royalist military opponents. Political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra's return from 15 years in exile in 2023 on the same day that Srettha ascended to the country's premiership.

Srettha defended his appointment of former Shinawatra lawyer Pichit Chuenban, who was briefly imprisoned for contempt of court in 2008 over an alleged bribery attempt, arguing that it was legitimate. The bribery claim was never substantiated, and Pichit resigned in May, reported CNA. Paetongtarn helped run the hotel arm of the family's business empire before entering politics three years ago and has never held elected office, Al Jazeera said. She was a near-constant presence on the campaign trail in the 2023 elections when she was one of Pheu Thai's prime minister candidates, giving birth just two weeks before polling day.

","Thailand’s Parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra as the country's 31st Prime Minister. At 37, Paetongtarn, daughter of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, will succeed Srettha Thavisin, who was ousted by the constitutional court for ethics violations. This marks the fourth time a Shinawatra family member has become Prime Minister. The vote saw 319 MPs in favor, 145 against, and 27 abstentions. Srettha’s removal highlights Thailand’s ongoing political instability, exacerbated by recent judicial actions against political parties and leaders.",International News,77,424
Indian Express ,2024-07-20 00:00:00,"ED seizes over Rs 1-Cr cash, undisclosed assets during raids against Cong MLA, others","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Saturday said it has seized Rs 1.42 crore in cash, documents related to more than 30 “undisclosed” flats and land during searches against Haryana Congress MLA Rao Dan Singh, his son and some business entities as part of a bank-loan fraud-linked money-laundering investigation.

The raids were launched on Thursday (July 18) in Mahendragarh and Gurugram in Haryana, apart from Delhi and Jamshedpur (Jharkhand), against the legislator, his family, a linked company called Suncity Projects Private Limited, another company called Allied Strips Limited (ASL) and its promoters Mohinder Agrawal, Gaurav Agrawal and some others.

ASL manufactures cold roll steel products.

The money-laundering investigation stems from a CBI FIR filed against the accused, who were charged with committing “fraud” by siphoning off and diverting funds, criminal misappropriation, criminal breach of trust and cheating, and causing wrongful loss of more than Rs 1,392.86 crore to a consortium of banks led by the Canara Bank.
Rao Dan Singh (65) represents the Mahendragarh seat in the 90-member Haryana Assembly. Election to the Haryana Assembly is slated to be held later this year.

The four-term MLA and businessman had contested the recent Lok Sabha polls from the Bhiwani-Mahendragarh seat as a Congress nominee. He lost the electoral contest to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Dharambir Singh by a margin of more than 41,000 votes.

He is considered to be close to former chief minister and current leader of opposition in the Haryana Assembly Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

The ED claimed that the modus operandi of the alleged bank-loan fraud “included siphoning off of the funds borrowed from banks to other companies in the form of unsecured loans and advances, writing off debts of its various debtors, bogus transactions etc”.

The searched entities have been found to have falsified their books of accounts, it claimed.","The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has seized Rs 1.42 crore in cash and documents related to over 30 undisclosed flats and land during raids linked to a money-laundering investigation involving Haryana Congress MLA Rao Dan Singh, his son, and associated business entities.

deccanchronicle,2024-08-09 00:00:00,Slimy Promise: Tadpole Water and the Weight Loss Craze,"In the ever-evolving world of weight loss miracles, where kale smoothies and unicorn tears have had their moment, there’s a new amphibian-themed contender making a splash: tadpole water. Yes, you read that right. Tadpole water—pond water’s sophisticated cousin—is causing a stir on the internet faster than you can say “ribbit.”







The Buzz Behind Tadpole Water



So, what’s the deal with tadpole water? According to fervent believers (and a few tadpole enthusiasts), this elixir of sliminess supposedly taps into the ancient secrets of tadpole metabolism. Proponents claim that by sipping on this concoction, you’re essentially channeling the tadpole's ability to transform from a squishy little swimmer into a sleek, agile frog.





Why It’s Good (Supposedly)

Advocates of tadpole water argue that it’s loaded with essential nutrients, enzymes, and even a touch of tadpole magic that accelerates fat burning. Plus, it’s eco-friendly—after all, tadpoles are practically a renewable resource in any backyard pond. It’s a win-win for your waistline and the environment.







But Wait, There’s More (Harms, That Is)



Before you dive headfirst into tadpole water, consider the flip side. Critics warn of potential downsides, such as a sudden affinity for croaking, an unshakable urge to hop instead of walk, and an inexplicable attraction to lily pads. Plus, let's not overlook the fact that tadpole water isn’t exactly FDA-approved. You might end up with a stomach full of regrets and a digestive system as chaotic as a frog chorus.





The Science (Or Lack Thereof)

In terms of scientific backing, tadpole water falls somewhere between wishful thinking and pure pond scum. There’s no substantial evidence that slurping down tadpole essence will magically shrink your waistline. Sure, tadpoles are cute and all, but they’re not wizards. They won’t magically make your muffin top disappear overnight.







The Verdict: To Tadpole or Not to Tadpole?

Ultimately, the choice is yours. If you’re feeling adventurous and don’t mind the odd amphibious side effect, tadpole water might be your next Instagram-worthy experiment. Just remember, weight loss fads come and go faster than a frog’s leap. What’s trendy today might be tomorrow’s embarrassing Facebook memory.







So, as you ponder your next dietary leap, consider this: maybe the real secret to weight loss isn’t in the latest fad, but in good old-fashioned moderation and a balanced diet. And if you do decide to take a sip of tadpole water, just be sure to thank the little critters for their contribution—whether it works or not, they deserve a round of applause for stirring up the internet yet again.





In conclusion, while tadpole water might be the talk of the town today, who knows what tomorrow will bring? Perhaps we’ll be discussing the benefits of cricket juice or sloth yoga. Until then, stay quirky, stay skeptical, and above all, stay hydrated (preferably without tadpoles)."," Tadpole water is causing a stir on the internet faster than you can say “ribbit” It's loaded with essential nutrients, enzymes, and even a touch of tadpole magic that accelerates fat burning.

Reacting to a US official's comment that the country is disappointed over the symbolism and timing of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia, New Delhi on Thursday said that all countries have the“freedom of choice” to decide their bilateral relations based on “mutuality of interests”. It also emphasised the country's longstanding ties with Russia.
Speaking to the media, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said, “We must understand that India has a longstanding relationship with Russia that is based on mutuality of interests. In a multipolar world, all countries have the freedom of choice. It is essential for everybody to be mindful of and appreciate such realities.”
During a US Congress hearing on Tuesday, the assistant secretary of state for South and Central Asia, Donald Lu, expressed his disappointment over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent state visit to Moscow. “I could not agree with you more about our disappointment about the symbolism and the timing of Prime Minister Modi's trip to Moscow. We are having those tough conversations with our Indian friends,” PTI quoted the US official as saying.
He made these remarks while responding to a question on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visit to Russia by Congressman Joe Wilson, a former co-chair of the Caucus of India and Indian Americans.
Lu added that the visit happened when Russia attacked a children's hospital in Ukraine's capital city of Kyiv. The official also noted that India did not sign any major defence deals or technology cooperation, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi told President Putin on live television that the war could not be won on the battlefield.

Referring to New Delhi's defence cooperation with Russia, he said that he shares those concerns but India's defence imports from Russia have been declining. ""The Indians have cancelled billions of dollars in defence purchases over these last two and a half years because the Russians can't deliver anymore. So, we're working very hard on that,” Lu said.

With more than two-thirds of market participants starting their investing journeys during this time, many have experienced a booming market that has generally favored those who jump in when prices fall.However, experts caution that while this approach has worked well in a thriving market, it may not guarantee success in the future.As market conditions evolve, investors should be wary of simply relying on past trends.Since April 1, 2020, the BSE 500 Index has delivered impressive returns, boasting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32%.  Data shows that out of 54 months during this timeframe, there were 39 months with positive returns, averaging 4.3% each month. In contrast, only 15 months saw negative returns, with an average decline of 2.6%. This environment has conditioned investors to view market dips as opportunities rather than setbacks. For instance, on days when the BSE 500 Index declined, domestic investors poured an average of Rs 914 crore into the market. In stark contrast, when the index increased, they invested only Rs 443 crore. This illustrates a clear trend: investors are more inclined to buy when prices are down.""Since 1 April, 2020, we have seen BSE 500 Index deliver 2.5x returns or 32% CAGR. These strong returns were delivered with very limited drawdowns. Thus, we have seen 39 months of positive returns of average 4.3% monthly return. Number of months witnessing a drawdown were limited to just 15 months, with an average decline of 2.6%. In this environment, investors have continuously been conditioned to invest more and more capital as soon as they see a market decline. This sort of Pavlovian conditioning has strengthened with each market rally post a dip. Thus, over the last 4.5 years, we have seen Indian domestic investors pour in 2x more money on a down day versus when markets (BSE 500 Index used as proxy for markets) are up,"" said Vinay Paharia CIO at PGIM Mutual Fund.A Pavlovian Response
This behavior resembles a Pavlovian response, where investors have been trained to react to market declines by investing more. Each market rally following a dip has reinforced this mindset. Over the past four and a half years, the tendency to ""buy the dip"" has become almost instinctual for many.
""Investors should be very careful to not extrapolate past trends while engaging in investing, especially in current market environment. Pavlovian conditioning of investors ensures that every dip gets bought into. However, the results of such investing activity may not produce the desired outcomes, especially if held for short to medium term. Hence Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware),"" said Paharia.
 Investors should carefully consider their strategies and be mindful that not every dip will lead to a recovery.
","Over the past 4.5 years, Indian investors have developed a pattern of ""buying the dip,"" especially after COVID-19. Since April 2020, the BSE 500 Index has delivered a 32% compound annual growth rate (CAGR), with 39 out of 54 months showing positive returns.

Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Thursday (October 10, 2024) presided over a review meeting on the party’s shock defeat in the Haryana Assembly polls and discussed the possible reasons for the setback.

Next week, on October 17, the party is likely to convene a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) for a more detailed analysis of the party’s “unexpected” results in Haryana.

Besides Mr. Kharge, Thursday’s meeting was attended by Leader of the Opposition (LoP) in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, Congress general secretary (organisation) K.C. Venugopal and senior observers for the polls Ajay Maken and Ashok Gehlot among others. Congress in-charge of the State Deepak Babaria joined the meeting online.

“We held a review meeting on Haryana election results. As you all know, as the exit polls and opinion polls had showed, the results were unexpected. There was a lot of difference between exit polls and actual results. We discussed that, what could be the reasons for that. We will take appropriate steps going forward on this,” Mr. Maken said.

On infighting hurting the party, he said, “There are various reasons, from the Election Commission to internal differences, we have discussed all that, and will do so in future as well because such a big upset...we cannot discuss everything in one or one-and-a-half hour.”

Party’s clarification
Amid reports that the meeting focussed on internal sabotage and the questionable role played by some key party functionaries, the Congress President’s office issued a clarification. “Following Congress party’s meeting today to discuss the results of Haryana elections, there have been numerous baseless source-based news circulating in media....We request you to stick to our formal briefing and desist from any conjectures, that deviate from the official brief,” read a statement issued by party secretary Pranav Jha.

“The party has decided to depute a technical team to look into complaints and discrepancies noted by our candidates. The Congress will issue a detailed response based on the fact-finding team’s report,” the statement added.

The party’s internal meeting comes a day after a Congress delegation called on the Election Commission (EC) to demand a thorough probe into “discrepancies” found in some electronic voting machines (EVMs) during the counting of votes of the Haryana Assembly polls.","Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge chaired a review meeting on October 10, 2024, to assess the party’s unexpected defeat in the Haryana Assembly polls.

Hindustan Times,2025-01-02 00:00:00,"What is the Turo app, emerging as a link in New Orleans and Las Vegas attacks?","Turo app, a central link between two New Year tragedies: a “coincidence,” or something more? 2025 started off on a tragic note in the US with deadly attacks in New Orleans and Las Vegas, sending shockwaves across the world. Although the preliminary investigations of both cases suggested that they were not connected, some shocking links between the two have indeed come to light, compelling authorities to reconsider their stance. The FBI is probing both cases as potential acts of terror. Suspects in each case - Shamsud Din Jabbar for the Bourbon Street horror that left 15 dead, and Matthew Livelsberger as the driver of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside Donald Trump’s hotel - are US Army veterans. Both men named as suspects in the New Year’s Day incidents are dead. On top of that, they are believed to have rented the respective vehicles at the centre of these cases via the same app, Turo. 
What is Turo?
According to its website, Turo is a car rental marketplace that allows interested parties to “rent anything from daily drivers to pickup trucks, from trusted, local hosts.” The car-sharing process facilitated by the rental app proceeds in such a way that it doesn’t demand in-person meetings between the “hosts” and “guests.” According to Newsweek, the San Francisco-based company was founded in 2010. As an alternative to traditional car rental services, the platform operates in the US, Canada, Australia and France. The company’s vice president of communications, Steve Webb, disclosed that they are fully cooperating with the investigations. As of now, they are not “aware of anything in this guest’s background that would have identified him as a trust and safety threat,” he said of the New Orleans attack. A Ford pickup truck is in the spotlight since 42-year-old Shamsud Din Jabbar allegedly rented the vehicle, ramming through gatherings of New Year revellers on Bourbon Street. The incident killed 15 people and injured dozens of others. Jabbar was ultimately fatally shot after he opened fire on two cops at the scene, who sustained injuries after the firefight. On the flip side, Matthew Livelsberger, aka the Las Vegas explosion suspect, was behind the wheel of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside the Trump International Hotel at Las Vegas Boulevard and Sammy Davis Jr Drive. The silver Cybertruck was also allegedly rented through the same carsharing company.
Officials respond
“We are heartbroken to learn that one of our host’s vehicles was involved in this awful incident. We are actively partnering with the FBI. We are not currently aware of anything in this guest’s background that would have identified him as a trust and safety threat to us at the time of the reservation,” a Turo spokesperson told News Nation. According to Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin Mc Mahill, authorities deemed the two attacks as isolated incidents. At the moment, they’ve called the app’s involvement in both cases as a “coincidence.”

Described as the “world’s largest car sharing marketplace,” Turo allows a person to book a vehicle as long as they provide a driver’s licence, are above 18 years of age and provide personal information for approval.

The app details, ““Entrepreneurs can take the wheel of their futures by becoming hosts and building car sharing businesses on Turo, leveraging an established platform to scale their businesses and meet their goals. With Turo, everyone has the power to get in the driver’s seat.”","The Turo app, a car-sharing platform, is under scrutiny after vehicles rented through it were involved in two New Year’s Day tragedies in the U.S. In New Orleans, Shamsud Din Jabbar used a rented Ford pickup to ram into crowds, killing 15. In Las Vegas, Matthew Livelsberger drove a rented Tesla Cybertruck that exploded near Trump International Hotel. Both suspects, Army veterans, died during the incidents. While authorities initially deemed the cases unrelated, the shared use of Turo raises questions about its vetting processes. Turo is cooperating with the FBI, calling the link a coincidence, as investigations continue.",International News,98,568

The Arunachal Times,2024-08-21 00:00:00,Water supply disruption in ICR,"ITANAGAR, 20 Aug: A major water crisis is reportedly looming over Naharlagun and Nirjuli township areas as the Public Health Engineering and Water Supply department begins reconstructing the suspension bridge for the DI 300 mm water supply line over the Nyorch stream on August 23.

In an official communiqué, the executive engineer (EE) of the PHED & WS Naharlagun Division informed that the bridge partially collapsed on August 2, 2024, as villagers and other residents used it for commuting to their fields and for daily activities. The department further noted that the bridge reconstruction may take 15 days or longer, during which the drinking water supply would be affected.


“The department plans to completely reconstruct the dilapidated suspension bridge starting August 23, 2024, and it may take around 15 days to complete and resume normal water supply to the consumers of Naharlagun and Nirjuli townships,” the EE of the PHED Naharlagun Division stated.

The EE added that drinking water supply to affected areas would be provided via Tata mobiles and tankers. Hydrant points and concerned officials and staff have been assigned to manage water supply from tankers and Tata mobiles.

The 60-meter-long span wire rope suspension bridge over the Nyorch stream was originally constructed solely for crossing the DI 300 mm water supply mains and was commissioned on January 31, 2008, to provide drinking water to the Naharlagun-Nirjuli twin townships.

It was further noted that the bridge construction was undertaken under the Augmentation of Water Supply to Naharlagun-Nirjuli Township Phase-1 (7MLD), sanctioned under the NLCPR in March 2004 by the DoNER Ministry, Government of India.

Meanwhile, water supply pipeline from the Poma River to Itanagar has been damaged, which has affected drinking water supply to Itanagar.

The Arunachal Times ,2024-07-22 00:00:00,Recruit commerce teachers and professors,"Through your esteemed daily I would like to urge the state government to recruit more PGTs and assistant professors in the commerce department of various government schools and colleges.

As we all know, commerce is one of the most important subjects in our daily life. It is being practiced even by illiterate or uneducated folks of our state in the economy. However, the fact is that our government is not paying any heed to commerce education. In various schools and colleges of our state, the teacher-student ratio is not at par, and subject teachers are inadequate.

Many CBOs are hiring commerce teachers own their own capacity, without government support. For instance, the Nyishi Elite Society (NES) has hired many commerce teachers in the recent years. I applaud the NES from the bottom of my heart for doing such a noble job to uplift not only their society but unemployed commerce graduates also. The government has not recruited commerce teachers since 2018, be it PGT or assistant professor, except the Arunachal Pradesh University, Pasighat. Many colleges and schools are running with a few numbers of commerce teachers. Their workload is very heavy, compared to others.

On the second day of the 8th Legislative Assembly sitting, many legislators underscored the topics related to education and health. They placed their points to focus on both sectors. I request the legislators to turn their words into action. As we all know, action speaks louder than words. In fact, the education and health sectors in our state are in a dilapidated condition. We are second from the bottom in the national literacy rate, as per the 2011 census. To improve our literacy rate and overall growth in the education sector, our government had announced the year 2021 as the Year of Education and placed crores of money for the same in the budget session. However, the outcome of that dedicated year is dismal and very disappointing.

So I request the government to pay heed to the education sector and recruit more commerce teachers to maintain the teacher-student ratio. Simultaneously, it will help to boost the education sector and ease the unemployment crisis as well.

MCom, MPhil, BEd with NET, SLET and APTET graduates","Through this letter, the writer urges the state government to recruit more PGTs and assistant professors in commerce for government schools and colleges. Commerce is crucial, yet the government neglects this subject, leading to an inadequate teacher-student ratio. CBOs like the Nyishi Elite Society (NES) have independently hired commerce teachers, but government recruitment has been absent since 2018.

Mint,2024-08-28 00:00:00,"Govt may relax export ban on non-basmati white rice amid surplus, says Pralhad Joshi","New Delhi: The Indian government is looking at relaxing its year-old export ban on non-basmati white rice amid surplus stock and a significant surge in paddy sowing, said union minister for consumer affairs, food and public distribution Pralhad Joshi. The ban, which took effect on 20 July 2023, was brought in to ensure the country had sufficient stock for domestic consumption and to cool prices.

A potential easing of the ban would benefit farmers, traders and exporters who have been seeking a relaxation to capitalise on the high global demand for Indian rice. The decision will also bring relief to rice-consuming nations that have been asking the Indian government to ease the ban.

Currently, basmati rice can be exported only above a floor price, while parboiled rice attracts a 20% export duty, and non-basmati and broken-rice exports are completely prohibited.
“We all know what happened due to El Niño last year. But in spite of that we were able to keep food inflation well under control,” Joshi said at an Mint event on Tuesday. ""Despite the expected negative impact of the weather phenomenon, our paddy/rice production was robust last year. There is now a demand to allow exports of non-basmati rice, where restrictions were put in place last year keeping the ill effects of El Niño in mind,” the minister said.

“We are now thinking whether to allow such exports as the country has sufficient food grain stocks [and enough]] to fulfill the needs of other countries as well,” he added.
Mint reported on 6 August that the ban on exporting non-basmati white rice may be lifted in view of bountiful rains and improved paddy cultivation this year. Mint also reported about swelling stocks on 9 July and how a bountiful harvest could prompt the government to relax curbs on rice exports.
Non-basmati white rice exports plunge 78%
The export restrictions have affected India's trade arithmetic as well. Rice exports during April-June fell by nearly 34% to 3.2 million tonnes (mt) after the export of non-basmati white rice was restricted last July. According to commerce ministry data, exports of non-basmati white rice plunged 78% to about 300,000 tonnes, while broken rice exports fell by 8% to 300,000 tonnes and parboiled rice exports dropped 11% to 1.5 mt.
Vijay Setia, former president of the All India Rice Exporters Association, said, “By banning rice exports, the government has successfully controlled ‘rice inflation’, and now it's time to re-evaluate the policy in the changing scenario of comfortable rice availability.”

According to the latest data from the agriculture ministry, the paddy sowing area increased by 16% to 39 million hectares, and pulses sowing area increased by 7% to 12 million hectares as of 23 August.

In an interview to Mint, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand had said the increase in paddy sowing and comfortable buffer stock had eased concerns about rice shortages. ""I feel the supply side of rice is not worrisome. It's a comfortable situation. So, even if the ban is removed at this time, I think excess quantities will not leave the country,” Chand said, adding that rice prices have moderated in India and abroad.

In FY24, India exported a total of 15.7 mt of rice, including 2.36 mt of non-basmati white rice, 545,000 tonnes of broken rice and 7.57 mt of parboiled rice, against 21.8 mt in FY23. India is the second-largest producer of rice after China and the largest exporter globally, contributing at least 40% to the global trade before the export curbs were imposed.","Indian Minister Pralhad Joshi has indicated that the government might ease the export ban on non-basmati white rice due to a current surplus in production. The export restriction was initially imposed to ensure domestic supply and manage prices amid concerns of rising inflation and food security. However, with an ample supply of rice in the country, officials are reconsidering the ban to potentially boost exports and support farmers. Joshi’s statement suggests that the government is weighing the benefits of both domestic stability and international trade. The potential relaxation of the ban could provide relief to exporters and create new market opportunities, while also balancing the needs of the local market.",National News,110,585
The Sikkim Express,2024-08-17 00:00:00,"DON’T IGNORE SKINCARE AFTER 60 DR DEEPALI BHARDWAJ, MD Brown patches, skin cancers, warts need proper attention","Skin disorders among the elderly are often multifactorial, stemming from various causes including reactions to medications, age-related conditions, and lifestyle factors. It is imperative for geriatric individuals to seek the expertise of a qualified dermatologist to address these issues effectively. Despite much of the skincare industry targeting younger consumers, it's crucial for the elderly population to prioritize their skin health, as many conditions can be managed with proper care and attention.

 

In India, as in many parts of the world, adults face a plethora of skin issues influenced by climate, lifestyle, genetics, and environmental factors, which can have a greater impact on elderly individuals. According to the 2011 Census, India has a substantial elderly population, with around 104 million individuals aged 60 years or above, the majority of whom reside in rural areas.


 

Research indicates that over 90% of senior citizens suffer from various skin disorders, including seborrheic keratoses (brown patches), skin cancers, warts, and skin tags, among others. These disorders can be attributed to factors such as reactions to medications, age-related conditions like nutritional deficiencies, blood diseases, liver problems, as well as lifestyle and dietary choices.

 

Furthermore, common age-related skin issues such as 'laugh lines' and 'worry lines' become more prominent as individuals reach their 40s to 50s, due to declining skin elasticity, loss of subcutaneous fat, stress, and obesity. Age spots, which manifest as patches on the skin, are also prevalent on the arms, hands, and legs.

 

Skin cancer resulting from UV exposure and the development of precancerous growths are significant concerns among the elderly. Additionally, dry or itchy skin, often attributed to the drying up of oil glands, is a common complaint among individuals above 60 years of age.


 

Moreover, geriatric individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or those who have undergone surgeries require special attention to prevent complications such as poor wound healing and infections. Therefore, timely intervention and comprehensive care are essential for maintaining the skin health of the elderly population.

 

Why older people need precise care

Special attention to skincare is essential for elderly individuals, particularly due to the potential for serious complications arising from other medical issues they may have.

 

Diabetic patients and those who are chronically unwell or bedridden are prone to developing pressure ulcers, bedsores, and numbness due to poor blood circulation, making skincare for the elderly complex. In the event of injuries, elderly patients require thorough examination, appropriate medication, and proper re-positioning to prevent complications.


 

One common first-aid remedy for minor cuts and wounds is a potassium permanganate soak, which can be prepared at home. Dissolve two to three crystals of potassium permanganate in one mug of lukewarm water to create a light pink solution. Dip cotton balls into the solution and apply them to the wounded area for five minutes before washing it with clean water and applying medication recommended by a doctor.

 

Dry skin is a frequent complaint among diabetic patients. Rather than relying on misleading advertisements, individuals should focus on improving their diet, incorporating foods rich in omega fatty acids such as flax seeds. Additionally, transparent soap, which contains more glycerine than translucent or colored soaps, can help alleviate dry skin. For cracked feet and hands, a mixture of glycerine with crushed camphor can be highly effective. Combine two tablespoons of crushed camphor with 200 ml glycerine and apply the mixture twice a day.

 

When using body sprays or perfumes, it's advisable to apply them to clothing rather than directly on the skin to avoid potential irritation or allergic reactions. Taking such precautions and adhering to proper skincare practices can significantly improve the overall skin health of elderly individuals, particularly those with underlying medical conditions.

 

Preventive measures 

For essential geriatric skincare, focus on simple routines that promote skin health and minimise common age-related concerns.

 

Exfoliate: To promote skin renewal, incorporate gentle exfoliation into your skincare routine once or twice a week. Choose mild exfoliants such as gentle scrubs or chemical exfoliants specifically formulated for sensitive and mature skin. This helps to effectively remove dead skin cells and maintain skin health.


 

Regularly cleanse: For regular skincare, opt for a mild, fragrance-free cleanser to gently cleanse the skin without stripping its natural oils. Avoid hot-water showers, as they can lead to excessive dryness; instead, use lukewarm water for bathing to maintain skin hydration.

 

Sun protection: For effective sun protection, utilize broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher to shield your skin from harmful UV rays. Additionally, employ protective clothing and wide-brimmed hats when outdoors, and seek shade whenever possible. With increasing pollution levels, more patients are reporting skin allergies, while dermatologists observe a surge in skin cancer cases attributed to cumulative sun damage.

 

Moisturise : After showering, promptly apply a rich, hydrating moisturizer to retain moisture and maintain supple skin. Look for products containing hyaluronic acid or glycerin for optimal hydration.

 

Maintain adequate hydration: Ensure proper hydration by drinking an ample amount of water to keep the skin hydrated from the inside out. In addition, consider using a humidifier indoors, particularly in dry climates, to help maintain optimal moisture levels in the air, which contributes to overall skin hydration.

 

Avoid harsh products: Avoid using harsh soaps, alcohol-based products, or strongly fragranced items that may cause irritation to ageing skin. Opt for gentle, fragrance-free alternatives to maintain the skin's delicate balance and minimize discomfort.

 

Sleep well: Prioritize adequate sleep, as it allows the skin to rejuvenate and repair during the night. Create a comfortable sleeping environment with quality bedding and establish a relaxing bedtime routine to promote restful sleep and support skin health.

 

Exercise regularly: Engage in regular exercise to enhance blood circulation, promoting overall skin health. It's advisable to consult a healthcare professional for personalized exercise recommendations tailored to individual capabilities and health status.

 

Consume a healthy diet: Opt for a nutritious diet comprising a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins to provide essential nutrients for skin nourishment. Incorporate antioxidant-rich foods to help combat free radicals and promote overall skin health.

 

Routine check-ups: Schedule routine skin check-ups with a dermatologist to monitor any changes, detect potential issues early, and receive personalized advice for maintaining skin health. Regular check-ups are essential for proactive skincare management.

 

 Manage stress: Effectively manage stress by incorporating techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or gentle yoga into your routine to reduce its impact on the skin. Customize these skincare practices to meet individual needs, and consider seeking personalized advice from a healthcare professional or dermatologist, particularly for older adults, to optimize stress management strategies.

 

See a doctor: For any geriatric skin issue, I strongly advise consulting a qualified doctor or dermatologist instead of attempting personal treatments based on incomplete information. Early diagnosis is key to faster recovery and effective management.

 

Ignoring or underestimating geriatric skin problems is unwise. It's crucial to seek the expertise of a dermatologist for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, prioritizing skincare and sun protection is vital for maintaining optimal skin health, particularly in the hot climate of India.

 

Ensure proper wound care: Ensure prompt and proper wound care by treating cuts, bruises, or wounds immediately to prevent infection. Thoroughly cleanse the wound with mild soap and water, then apply the appropriate dressing to promote healing and prevent complications.","Elderly individuals face multifactorial skin disorders due to factors like medication reactions, age-related changes, and lifestyle.

The Hindu,2024-09-24 00:00:00,Japan urges China to protect Japanese citizens after schoolboy stabbing incident,"Japan’s top diplomat asked China to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens there after the fatal stabbing of a Japanese schoolboy and demanded a crackdown on what she called “groundless, malicious and anti-Japanese” social media posts that threaten children’s safety.

China’s Foreign Ministry said the attack was an isolated case and urged Japan to react calmly.

Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa asked her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, conduct a full investigation into the stabbing and provide a clear explanation to Japan about what happened, and to punish the suspect and implement preventive measures for the future.

Ms. Kamikawa said Beijing should take concrete steps to ensure safety of Japanese residents, especially children, in China, according to Japan’s Foreign Ministry. The two ministers met in New York on Monday (September 23, 2024) on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meeting.

The 10-year-old boy was stabbed on September 18 near the gate of the Shenzhen Japanese School. The attacker, identified as a 44-year-old man, was arrested on the spot and is being investigated, according to Chinese officials. No motive for the attack was immediately clear.

Ms. Kamikawa has said the attack occurred despite Tokyo’s request to Beijing for increased security for Japanese citizens and around Japanese schools ahead of the Sept. 18 anniversary of the Mukden Incident in 1931, which China marks as the beginning of the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, now northeast China.

On June 24th, a knife attack at a school bus stop for a Japanese school in the southeastern city of Suzhou killed a Chinese national who was trying to stop the attacker and injured a Japanese mother and her child.

Earlier in June, a Chinese man stabbed four U.S. university instructors at a public park in Jilin in the northeast and a Chinese person who tried to intervene. The four instructors from Cornell College were teaching at Beihua University. Their injuries were not critical.

Ms. Kamikawa also told Wang that “groundless, malicious and anti-Japanese social media postings and others, including those targeting Japanese schools, directly affect the safety of children and are absolutely unacceptable,” demanding China a thorough crackdown as soon as possible, according to a ministry statement.

Wang said the stabbing was an “accidental, individual case” and that China would handle the case under the law, the ministry said. It said Ms. Kamikawa and Wang agreed to further cooperate to achieve progress on the issues as soon as possible.

“China will investigate and handle this isolated attack on a Japanese student in Shenzhen in accordance with the law and will ensure the safety of all foreign citizens in China as always,” the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement issued Tuesday (September 24, 2024). “Japan should treat the matter calmly and rationally and avoid politicisation and amplification.”

Safety concerns are rising among the Japanese business community in China.

Vice Foreign Minister Yoshifumi Tsuge was in Beijing on Monday (September 23, 2024) for talks with his counterpart, Sun Weidong, and conveyed a similar message of concern. Tsuge then met with representatives of the Japanese business community to hear their thoughts on safely operating in China.

Tsuge said Japan is spending 43 million yen ($300,000) to urgently beef up security around Japanese schools and their bus stops during commuting hours and plans to seek additional budget to staff security guards on Japanese school buses.

Tetsuro Honma, head of Panasonic Holdings Corp.’s Chinese subsidiary and head of the Japanese Chamber Commerce and Industry in China, told Tsuge that the latest stabbing, in addition to an earlier case in June, were extremely regrettable, according to the ministry.

Honma said ensuring the safety of employees and their families is crucial for Japanese companies operating in China.

About 100,000 Japanese students, employees and others live in China.","Japan’s Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa urged China to ensure the safety of Japanese citizens after a Japanese schoolboy was fatally stabbed in Shenzhen. She demanded a full investigation, punishment for the suspect, and action against anti-Japanese social media threats. China called the attack an isolated incident and promised legal action. Japan is increasing security around Japanese schools in China, as safety concerns grow among Japanese businesses operating there.",International News,68,625

U.S. stocks added a third straight day to their sell-off on Friday as lingering chaos related to a global technical outage caused by a software glitch added uncertainty to an already-anxious market.

The far-reaching, worldwide tech outage disrupted operations across multiple industries including airlines, banking and healthcare after the glitch in cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike's software caused Microsoft's Windows operating system to crash.

While the flaw was identified and fixes deployed, technical issues continue to affect some services.

Crowdstrike shares slid 12.1%, while rival cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and Sentinal One were up 1.6% and 8.5%, respectively.

All three major U.S. stock indexes were lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial average suffering the worst of it.

On a weekly basis, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 were on track for their worst week since April, while the Dow, having reached a series of all-time closing highs earlier in the week, appeared primed to post a Friday-to-Friday gain.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq seemed headed toward snapping its six-week winning streak.

""If you’re trying to fly today it was not a fun day, but overall for markets it doesn’t appear to be too big of a hiccup,"" Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group in Omaha, Nebraska. ""After a historic rally since May, this weakness seems to be just the market catching its breath.""

""You have to be kind of impressed how market participants have taken today’s huge outages in stride,"" Detrick added.

The smallcap Russell 2000 - a beneficiary of a recent pivot away from megacap growth stocks - was last off 0.6%.

The CBOE Market volatility index, considered a gauge of investor anxiety, touched its highest level since late April.

Nvidia shares led a sell-off in chips. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index underperformed the broader market, tumbling 2.8%.

Elsewhere, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams reiterated the central bank's commitment to bringing inflation down to its 2% target.

Financial markets have priced in a 93.5% likelihood that the Fed will enter a rate-cutting phase at the conclusion of its September meeting, according to CME's FedWatch tool.

The Sikkim Express,2024-10-13 00:00:00,Revolution of ODI Cricket,"Change is the only constant they say. Just like life, everything keeps changing and cricket is no exception. The game that originated as early as the 17th century was played in the traditional manner even after the formation of the International Cricket Council in 1909. Initially, it was known as the Imperial Cricket Board and consisted of England, Australia and South Africa. 

As time went by, more and more teams were added to the mix, but the format remained the same. This changed on a fateful January of 1971 when the first three days of an Australia vs England Test were washed away due to rain and the officials decided to have an ODI instead. 

This was the start of a revolution that changed the way the game was played. Let’s have a look at all the factors that revolutionised cricket:

Introduction of Limited Overs

Matches were reduced to a day with both teams playing a set number of balls. Since the number of overs was limited, batsmen had to accelerate their scoring trying to score as fast as they could. This increased the pace of the game significantly.

Day-Night Games

To attract more crowds and make the game more vibrant, day and night games were introduced. White-coloured kits were replaced by colourful clothing, while the colour of the ball was changed from red to white. An afternoon start allowed fans to catch the games after working hours.

Globalisation

As teams from across the globe got added to the mix, the game reached different parts of the world. This provided the associate nations an opportunity to showcase their skills at a global stage and resulted in more than a few upsets at tournaments as big as the World Cup. This made the tournament more competitive and unpredictable, but if you have to be on top of the game when it comes to the biggest tournament in ODIs, you can check Cricket World Cup betting sites.

Fielding Restrictions

The incorporation of fielding restrictions/powerplay resulted in more scoring opportunities for the batsmen and made the teams revise their strategies and increase their targets. High-scoring games became commonplace, and no matter how big the total, it was never out of reach.

Aggressive Batsmanship

The fielding restrictions gave batsmen a free hand to play some aggressive shots. This also paved the way for batsmen to develop some innovative and unorthodox shots like the reverse sweep, scoop, switch-hit, etc.

Innovative Deliveries

To counter the batsmen, even bowlers had to think out of the box and innovate some new kinds of deliveries. Fast bowlers came up with deliveries like the yorker and the slower ball, while spinners added deliveries like the ‘Doosra’ and the googly to their armour.

Fitness and Fielding

Along with batting and bowling, fielding also saw a massive shift. Teams placed special emphasis on fitness and conducted drills to enhance their fielding skills. Fans got to see a lot more direct hits, high-flying catches, lightning stumpings, etc.

Technology Advancement

The introduction of technologies like the Decision Review System and Hawk Eye helped umpires in better decision-making and added a whole new dimension to the game. This also gave the fans an opportunity to watch the game more closely.

All these factors revolutionised the game to an extent no one would have imagined. It turned the sport into a fast-paced and exciting format that continues to attract new fans. The format remains an important part of the game providing a perfect balance between Tests and T20s.","Cricket has undergone significant transformations since its inception in the 17th century. A pivotal change occurred in January 1971 when rain forced officials to switch a Test match between Australia and England to a One Day International (ODI), marking the beginning of a new era.

Key factors in this revolution include:

Limited Overs: Matches became single-day events, increasing scoring rates and game pace.
Day-Night Games: Colorful kits and white balls attracted larger crowds and allowed fans to enjoy matches post-work.
Globalisation: More teams joined international play, showcasing talent from associate nations and leading to unexpected World Cup upsets.
Fielding Restrictions: Powerplays allowed for higher scores and strategic adaptations.
Aggressive Batsmanship: Restrictions enabled innovative shots from batsmen.
Innovative Deliveries: Bowlers developed new techniques to counter aggressive batting.
Fitness and Fielding: Emphasis on fitness led to improved fielding skills.
Technology Advancement: Tools like DRS enhanced decision-making and fan engagement.
These changes have made cricket a fast-paced sport, balancing the traditional Tests and T20 formats, while continuing to attract new fans.",Sports,168,582

Signs of disintegration within the party are becoming evident, starting from the constituency of TMC state chief, Charles Pyngrope. Reports suggest that hundreds of party workers from his constituency are preparing to join the State Congress and are even pressuring Pyngrope to follow suit.
Despite repeated attempts to seek clarity, key TMC leaders, including Meghalaya in-charge Manas Bhuyan, state president Charles Pyngrope, and TMC Parliamentary Party president Mukul Sangma, have remained silent on the matter.
Earlier, Pyngrope admitted that the party lacks a significant vote share in the tribal belts of the Khasi-Jaintia Hills. He also cited a lack of communication from the party’s high command, contributing to the uncertainty surrounding TMC’s participation in the district council polls.
Previously, the party had announced that it was undecided on contesting the KHADC and JHADC elections.

Asked if he has a particular favourite among his cricketing milestones that includes an impressive ODI average of 44.11, he recalls his ‘dream Test debut’ where he scored 187 runs against Australia in 2013 at Mohali.

“I used to manifest making records much before the term 'manifestation’ became trendy. But in my very first international Test match, when I hit a century in 85 balls, I had no clue that I had broken a world record. I was simply happy that my position in the Indian team had become certain,” he laughed.
The innings that’s closest to his heart, however, remains the one at the Oval in the 2019 ODI World Cup against Australia, when a fast ball at 150 kmph by Pat Cummins hit him on the hand and broke his thumb.

“I was playing on 25 when that happened. I just downed a painkiller and continued batting. I made 117 of 109 balls in that innings and was the Player of the Match,” he proudly added.

Dhawan’s stint in the IPL also helped him build a big fan following. He played for Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai and finally finished with the Punjab Kings.

“I thoroughly enjoyed all my IPL stints. But the best, of course, was winning the IPL trophy in 2016 for Sunrisers Hyderabad by beating RCB in the finals. My partnership with the Hyderabad skipper, David Warner, was memorable.”

The Arjuna Awardee cricketer, who has since ventured into entrepreneurial endeavors including setting up a $75 million Sports Technology Fund, hosting a celebrity talk show, acting in the 2022 Hindi film Double XL, and now owning a team in the Delhi Premier League, says he has no specific plans for what’s next after retirement.

“There’s so much happening. I’d rather go with the flow. I just know that whatever I do will be a level above where I’ve already reached.”","
Shikhar Dhawan, the 38-year-old Indian cricketer, announced his retirement from all forms of cricket after a nearly two-decade-long career. Dhawan, known for his impressive achievements including being the Player of the Tournament in India's 2013 ICC Champions Trophy win and holding the world record for the fastest Test century on debut, shared his emotional reflections in an exclusive interview. He highlighted his memorable Test debut against Australia in 2013 and his determined innings at the 2019 ODI World Cup despite a broken thumb. Dhawan also fondly recalled his IPL victory with Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2016. Post-retirement, Dhawan has ventured into various entrepreneurial and entertainment endeavors, including a Sports Technology Fund, a celebrity talk show, and owning a Delhi Premier League team. While he has no specific plans for the future, he remains open to new opportunities.",Sports,136,420
Business Standard,2024-12-24 00:00:00,FMCG sees slowdown as food inflation bites hard,"The fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector has witnessed a significant slowdown due to rising prices, according to the latest Kantar FMCG Pulse report.

According to the report, not just the urban markets, rural ones too are showing signs of a slowdown.

The August-October (ASO) quarter reported a growth rate of just 4.3 per cent compared to 6.4 per cent in the same quarter last year, Kantar said.

“It is also a tad bit lower than 4.5 per cent (growth) we saw in the last quarter, ie Jul 24,” the report added. Talking about the urban sector, which has been seeing a marked slowdown in the past few quarters, the market research firm said it continued to see a sharp decline. Growth in volumes in the urban sector came in at 4.5 per cent compared to 6.9 per cent in the same period last year.

“On the face of it, there is definitely a slowdown. However, it is also true that a 4.5 per cent growth following a near 7 per cent growth in the previous term is extremely rare,” the report stated. “In fact, over the last five years, this has only happened in the quarters of 2024,” it added.

This slowdown has mainly been owing to increasing prices. Average household spend per capita has recorded a 13 per cent jump since the ASO quarter 2022, reaching ₹ 6,761 this October quarter.

The average cost of FMCG products jumped ₹ 4 to ₹ 137 a kg in the October quarter from ₹ 133 a kg in the preceding quarter this year. “This kind of growth in asingle consecutive quarter was only seen during the initial months of the 2022 inflation period,” the report stated.

This is reflective of the 11.1 per cent rise in the consumer food price index (CFPI) recorded for urban India in October 2024.

“This CFPI growth is the highest in 15 months. With no signs of food inflation relenting in the immediate future, we might see value growth rapidly drawing away from volume growth for some more time,” the report stated. “As a result, it is hard to see urban growing rapidly than the current levels. We are expecting similar levels of growth to continue into the first half of the next year,” it added.

Speaking to Business Standard

recently, Harsha Vardhan Agarwal, vicepresident and managing director, Emami Ltd, had said urban consumption had been affected by food inflation, adding that the industry hoped for improvement in the next one-two quarters.

Rural areas, too, are experiencing a slowdown. Growth in volumes in rural markets stood at 4 per cent in the ASO quarter — lagging urban. However, the rural slowdown, said Kantar, can be attributed to atta (wheat flour). “Non-atta rural FMCG growth is stable linearly and is growing seasonally,” the report stated.

Rural markets recorded a strong jump in personal care to 5.4 per cent in the ASO quarter, from 2.8 per cent in the same period last year.","The FMCG sector experienced a slowdown in the August-October (ASO) quarter, with growth declining to 4.3% compared to 6.4% in the same period last year, driven by rising prices, according to the Kantar FMCG Pulse report. Urban markets, already slowing, saw volume growth drop to 4.5% from 6.9% last year. Rural markets also lagged, with growth at 4%, although personal care in rural areas showed a significant jump to 5.4% from 2.8% last year.

Average household spending rose 13% year-on-year to ₹6,761, while FMCG product costs increased to ₹137/kg in the October quarter. Food inflation remains a key factor, with the consumer food price index (CFPI) for urban India rising 11.1% in October 2024, the highest in 15 months. This inflation-driven slowdown is expected to persist into the first half of 2025, with limited prospects for rapid recovery in urban consumption. Rural non-food FMCG growth, however, remains stable.",Business and Finance,148,494

JOHNSTON, Iowa — As Mid-South farmers completed their first winter canola harvest this summer, Corteva, along with partner Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, is pleased to share initial results from the pilot program: Pioneer® brand winter canola hybrids exceeded initial expectations with an average yield of 54 bu/A across 13 farms in western Kentucky and western Tennessee.1 Based on university trials, yield results of 45 to 55 bu/A is a common target for the crop.

“We couldn’t have asked for better results for our first harvest of winter canola,” said Chad Berghoefer, Corteva Agriscience Global Product Director, Biofuels. “We are very pleased with these yield results – as well as the excellent grain quality – and look forward to more farmers participating in the program next year.”

Pioneer’s long-standing canola breeding program has developed proprietary winter canola hybrids well adapted to perform in the southern U.S. and serve as a new alternative for winter crop rotations. With elite genetics powered by Pioneer®, farmers can expect high yield potential and consistent oil content across a wide range of growing conditions to increase their winter crop field profitability.

For the 2023-2024 season, 5,000 acres were contracted across western Kentucky and western Tennessee. After a successful harvest, the program significantly expanded, achieving more than 35,000 acres contracted for the next crop year and is expanding into southern Illinois, southern Indiana, northern Alabama, northern Mississippi, eastern Arkansas and eastern Missouri.

“We are excited about this program and hope to build on these promising results to meet consumers’ growing demand for renewable fuels, creating a more environmentally sustainable future – while driving additional revenue sources for farmers,” said Luis Copeland, Bunge’s Senior Director for Low Carbon Intensity Seeds. “We will add more delivery locations to provide farmers with more convenient options to transport their winter canola.”

The harvested winter canola is processed at a Bunge facility for the production of oil, which can be used as feedstock to the growing renewable fuels industry.

“We are proud of our unique partnership with Bunge and Corteva which allows us to cover the full value chain of the winter canola crop, from production to fuel,” said Stacey Orlandi, President of Chevron Renewable Energy Group. “Innovation and investment in the feedstock space is going to continue to be an important aspect for the future of the renewable fuels industry and collaborations like this one are helping to support growth of lower carbon intensity fuels for the market.""","Corteva Agriscience and its partner, Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC, achieved remarkable success in their winter canola pilot program, with an average yield of 54 bu/A across farms in Kentucky and Tennessee, exceeding expectations. This success has led to a significant expansion of the program from 5,000 acres to over 35,000 acres for the 2024-2025 season, with new locations added across the Mid-South.

The Telegraph,2024-08-28 00:00:00,"Refugees, human rights activists highlight fresh exodus of Rohingyas from Myanmar to escape genocide","Human rights activists and Rohingya refugees shared a stage here on Tuesday to highlight the fresh exodus of the Muslim-majority group from Myanmar to escape genocide.

Speakers at the event held at the Press Club of India included deputy minister of the country’s government in exile Aung Kyaw Moe — a Rohingya who joined online from the US.

Moe said: “Anyone regardless of their political ideology who has committed atrocities, war crimes or genocide, we should ensure that… the perpetrators are held accountable. Just because they are our political allies doesn’t mean they should enjoy immunity.”

The media conference was held to highlight a series of massacres of Rohingyas by the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine insurgent group that has denied the allegations. Video footage of an alleged massacre carried out by combat drones on Rohingyas fleeing to Bangladesh was also shown.

Ali Johar, a Rohingya refugee who is part of the Global Movement Against Statelessness, said: “In August 2017, the world witnessed the systematic extermination of the Rohingya, with more than 30,000 killed and over a million displaced…. Such acts were not mere moments of violence but a carefully orchestrated campaign of dehumanisation and a genocide through otherisation of Rohingya and massive hate campaigns against the community.”

He added: “While victims are waiting for justice, we witness the Arakan Army, a group that claims to be liberating the people of Arakan from military oppression, following a pattern of similar atrocities, propaganda, hate speech and racism against the Rohingya…. While the Arakan Army is finishing an unfinished genocide started by Myanmar’s Junta, a large civil society in Myanmar has chosen silence.”

Sabber Kyaw Min of the Rohingya Human Rights Initiative narrated how his relatives were among an estimated 135 people allegedly killed by the Arakan Army on May 1 in Houya Seri village. He demanded that the international community intervene, and the UN deploy a peacekeeping force.

Retired ambassador K.P. Fabian said even after several countries supported Myanmar’s prosecution in the International Court of Justice for the 2017 pogrom, “the genocide continues and the international community is unable to stop it…. Where is the Global South? If we in India believe Vasudhaiva
Kutumbakam (the whole world is a family), we have to act.”","Refugees and human rights activists are drawing attention to a new wave of Rohingya fleeing Myanmar to escape ongoing violence and persecution. This exodus highlights the severe human rights abuses and alleged genocide faced by the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. Many of these individuals are crossing borders into neighboring countries, seeking safety and asylum. The situation remains dire, with reports of violent clashes, forced displacement, and severe humanitarian needs. Human rights organizations are calling for international intervention and increased support for the Rohingya, urging governments and agencies to address the crisis and provide aid to those affected. The fresh wave of refugees underscores the urgent need for a resolution to the conflict and greater protection for the Rohingya community, who continue to suffer amid ongoing instability and violence in Myanmar.",National News,130,373
indian express,2024-07-13 00:00:00,India can become world’s 2nd largest economy by 2031: RBI deputy governor,"India can become the second largest economy by 2031 and the largest in the world by 2060, given the innate strengths of the country, said Reserve Bank deputy governor Michael D Patra.

India, however, will have to overcome various challenges with regard to labour productivity, infrastructure, contribution of manufacturing sector in GDP, and greening of the economy for sustainable development, he said in his address to the officials of the Indian Administrative Service at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, Mussoorie.

“Given the innate strengths, I described and the resolve to achieve its aspirational goals, it is possible to imagine India striking out into the next decade to become the second largest economy in the world not by 2048, but by 2031 and the largest economy of the world by 2060,” he said.
The senior RBI official further said it has been estimated that if India can grow at the rate of 9.6 per cent per annum over the next ten years, it will break free of the shackles of the lower middle income trap and become a developed economy.

“These gains need to be reflected in per capita income with two milestones – a per capita income level of USD 4516-14,005 to reach middle income country status, and beyond that level to attain the position of a developed country today. By 2047, however, the developed country threshold will have moved up to USD 34,000,” he said.

He said that current exchange rates determined in the market are subject to bouts of volatility. Hence, their application as denominators to GDP measured in national currencies may not be appropriate for cross-country comparisons.

An alternative measure is purchasing power parity (PPP). It is the price of an average basket of goods and services in each country.","Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Michael D.

Patra emphasized the need for India to achieve a 9.6% annual growth rate over the next decade to transition from a lower-middle-income to a developed economy.

The Hindustan Times,2024-09-16 00:00:00,"Many challenges to early Delhi polls, say experts","Under Section 15 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, ECI can notify general elections to the state assembly six months before the date of expiration of the assembly’s tenure. The current term of the Delhi assembly is set to expire on February 11, 2025. There is a multitude of challenges, such as shortened preparation time, electoral roll revision and EVM checks, among others, in holding early elections this November instead of the tentative schedule of February 2025, experts said, after Delhi chief minister (CM) Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday announced his decision to resign from his post. Kejriwal said on Sunday that the party would elect a successor as a CM, experts pointed out. “Arvind Kejriwal has announced that he will resign. His resignation will lead to the dissolution of the cabinet but not the assembly. He has also announced that the AAP legislative party will elect a successor. Though the Election Commission of India (ECI) can conduct state assembly election six months before the date of expiration of the assembly’s tenure, the dissolution of the assembly may pave the way for the early election to be held. So, without the dissolution of the assembly, the possibility of holding early election is low. It is the ECI, which has to take a final call on this,” a former chief electoral officer of Delhi, who did not want to be named, said.  Under Section 15 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, ECI can notify general elections to the state assembly six months before the date of expiration of the assembly’s tenure. The current term of the Delhi assembly is set to expire on February 11, 2025.  The last assembly election in Delhi was held on February 8, 2020. AAP secured 62 seats and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 8 seats in the 70-member assembly. Arvind Kejriwal took oath as the CM on February 16, the third time since 2013 when he first won the polls. Officials from the office of the chief electoral officer of Delhi said ECI announced the special summary revision of the photo electoral roll in August, keeping in mind the tentative schedule of February 2025 for the state polls. The ongoing exercise is scheduled to conclude in early January 2025, and the final publication of electoral rolls is planned for January 6, 2025. “For Maharashtra, Haryana and Jharkhand, the special summary revision was started months before the special summary revision in Delhi. So, it may be one of the challenges in conducting early polls in Delhi because the final electoral roll has to be published on January 6, for which an elaborate exercise is already going on,” an official, not wanting to be named, said.  The official said that besides the special summary revision, other preparations are also required, such as conducting first-level checking of electronic voting machines (EVMs) to ensure that EVMs kept in storage are in fine working condition, and holding meetings with representatives of political parties, government, police and security agencies for smooth conduct of the elections.  “Ideally, three to six months are required for making the necessary preparations for conducting the elections,” the former Delhi CEO said. Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said that Arvind Kejriwal’s demands for early election was full of contradictions. “If Arvind Kejriwal wants an early election he should recommend the dissolution of the assembly to pave the way for the early election. But instead of dissolving the assembly, he is talking about the election of a new chief minister. It is nothing but a drama to get headlines and mislead people,” he said. Delhi Congress president Devender Yadav said: “Congress is fully prepared for the assembly election in Delhi any day, and we are prepared to contest all 70 assembly seats. But I believe that Arvind Kejriwal is not serious about getting early elections done in Delhi.” The latest electoral roll data of Delhi was shared in May, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Delhi has 15,201,936 voters across 70 assembly constituencies as of May 7 — 885,483 more electors than those registered in 2019.  Sanjay Kumar, professor and co-director of Lokniti at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), said that according to rules, ECI is empowered to call early elections if the remaining term of the assembly is fewer than six months.  “The reasons behind Kejriwal’s decision to call for early election appears to be an attempt to create public sympathy on the jailing of AAP leaders, including himself, in the excise case. Kejriwal understands well that it is only now that he will may get some sympathy if he tries to go to polls. As time passes, the possibility of him getting sympathy over jailing of AAP leaders is likely to fade,” Kumar said.","Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced his intention to resign, leading to speculation about early assembly elections. While the Election Commission of India (ECI) can conduct elections six months prior to the assembly's term expiration on February 11, 2025, the assembly must be dissolved for early polls to take place. Experts highlight challenges in organizing elections this November, including the ongoing electoral roll revision and EVM checks, with the final electoral roll publication set for January 6, 2025. The ECI has already begun preparations for the anticipated February elections. Delhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva criticized Kejriwal's call for early elections, suggesting that he should recommend assembly dissolution instead of just appointing a new chief minister. Meanwhile, Congress leader Devender Yadav expressed confidence in being prepared for elections at any time.

Times of India,2024-12-31 00:00:00,"While Rohit Sharma has decided to retire after SCG Test, shouldn't he be saying goodbye immediately?","Melbourne: The number of runs Rohit Sharma has scored in the
Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) so far is one more than the number
of wickets (30) Jasprit Bumrah has picked since landing in
Australia last month. Three Tests, five innings, 31 runs. That's all
Rohit has managed in the ongoing series, and barely has he
managed to take his runs tally ahead of Bumrah's 30 wickets.
While the statistic is good for the laughs and social media memes,
on a serious note it is a sorry reflection of Rohit the batter. Not that
he has come across as a tactically sound and proactive Test
captain, but the extended lean patch has clearly and further
deteriorated his decision-making.
What’s the right move for Rohit Sharma’s cricketing journey?
Continue playing for a few more years Retirement
Rain saved India in Brisbane but proper five days of Test cricket at the MCG has served another stern reminder of
why the Indian captain's time is up in the whites. While there are murmurs of conversations with BCCI top brass
and selectors over retirement, it's understood that Rohit has already made up his mind.
 While Rohit Sharma has decided to retire after SCG Test, shouldn't he be saying goodbye immediately? 
When and where the announcement happens is anybody's guess but it's highly unlikely that the Indian captain will continue after the BGT. Rohit would undoubtedly like to convince selectors to allow him to stay for the World Test Championship (WTC) final, should India pull off a miracle and make it there. However, if they don't, Sydney is destined to be Rohit's last dance. That bit is absolutely clear and selectors are already in the know of what's approaching. However, the bigger question at this stage is not about retirement but whether Rohit deserves to be in the Playing XI at all? The runs aren't coming. Even after a decent series vs England at home, the Test average in 2024 has been in the mid 20s and he has only scored two centuries and two half-centuries in the 14 Tests he has played.
619 runs in 14 Tests would have pushed any batter out of the setup but Rohit, because of captaincy and reputation, has managed to hang on longer than he should have.
Apart from the lack of runs, the experiments in Melbourne -- Rohit at top, KL Rahul at No. 3 and Shubman Gill on the bench -- did more harm than good and it's just delaying the transition and opportunities to the next generation of superstars.
If you play Rohit in Sydney, the same batting order is likely to continue and it would mean Shubman Gill returns home after playing just three innings -- two of which had fluent starts. And KL Rahul continues to do something which he hasn't done often in his career -- bat at No.3. Australia have seen numerous Test retirements in the past but for India, more important than the retirement is the smooth transition. Many moons ago, MS Dhoni, a visionary leader, did just that when he retired midway through the series and handed over the reins to Virat Kohli.
Will Rohit follow suit or wait for the ""why nots"" to get louder?","Rohit Sharma's performance in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) has been underwhelming, scoring only 31 runs in five innings across three Tests. This puts him barely ahead of Jasprit Bumrah’s 30 wickets, highlighting his extended lean patch. While his tactical decisions as Test captain have also come under scrutiny, his poor form has further impacted his decision-making on the field.

Speculation is rife that Rohit has decided to retire from Test cricket after the Sydney Test, with selectors already in the loop. However, questions arise over whether he deserves a spot in the playing XI for the final game. In 2024, Rohit has averaged in the mid-20s in Tests, scoring 619 runs with just two centuries and two half-centuries in 14 matches—a record that would have sidelined most players.

Criticism has also been directed at Rohit’s decisions, such as benching Shubman Gill and experimenting with KL Rahul at No. 3, which has delayed the transition to younger talent. Comparisons are being drawn to MS Dhoni’s timely mid-series retirement, which allowed Virat Kohli to take over seamlessly. As India prioritizes a smooth transition, the question remains whether Rohit will follow Dhoni’s example or delay the inevitable.",Sports,195,535
The Pioneer,2024-12-19 00:00:00,Sacrificing Jharkhand’s Interests at the Altar of Politics,"
In an attempt to corner the central government, the Hemant Soren-led Jharkhand government is getting entangled in its web. According to the Supreme Court’s ruling in the MADA vs. SAIL case in July 2024, states can impose taxes on mineral rights under Entry 50 of List II of the Constitution. This landmark decision by a nine-judge bench overturned the 1989 ruling of a seven-judge bench in the India Cement case. With an 8:1 majority, the judgment grants states the power to levy taxes on minerals and land containing minerals — a boon for mineral-rich states like Jharkhand.
However, the Supreme Court also laid down some conditions to balance the interests of state governments and mining companies. The first condition was that the mining tax could be imposed only from April 1, 2005. Considering the immediate financial burden on mining companies, the court allowed the payment of this tax in installments over 12 years, starting from April 1, 2026. Also, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that no penalty or interest would be charged on this amount.
The Jharkhand government, one of the 80 petitioners in the case, had written to the central government in 2022, demanding dues worth ₹1.36 lakh crore under categories like washed coal royalty, common cause, land acquisition, and interest. In response to a related question posed in December 2023 by a then-serving MLA from Godda, the state government reported the amount as ₹1.48 lakh crore. During the elections, Hemant Soren frequently mentioned this figure of ₹1.36 lakh crore in his speeches and campaign posters. However, in response to an unstarred question posed in Parliament by Pappu Yadav, the amount cited was ₹1.40 lakh crore.
This discrepancy in the amount raises two key questions. First, the 2022 letter to the Centre included ₹60,000 crore as interest. Since the Supreme Court had explicitly ruled that no penalty or interest would apply to the outstanding dues, why did the Jharkhand government not reassess this amount after the verdict? The presentation of the same 2022 amount reflects negligence on the part of the state government and its officials. Second, after the Supreme Court’s ruling, the Jharkhand government introduced the Jharkhand Mineral-Bearing Land Tax Bill in September 2024. This bill established additional charges for various minerals, such as ₹100 per metric ton of coal, ₹70 for bauxite, and ₹50 for manganese. After passing this bill, the government should have re-estimated the dues based on the state’s mineral production and updated the figures accordingly. However, no such proactive measures were taken.
Rather than focusing on a procedural and well-structured approach to collecting the dues, the state government and its leader, Hemant Soren, appeared more interested in the political narrative. The state is currently grappling with a financial crunch as it struggles to fulfill its election promises. For instance, the Maiyan Samman Yojana alone requires around ₹17,000 crore for implementation. In the recently presented second supplementary budget, the government reduced allocations for nearly every department and diverted funds to just two — ₹6,390 crore for the Maiyan Samman Yojana and ₹2,577 crore for the waiver of electricity bills. In contrast, last year, the Rural Works Department received ₹1,413 crore in the second supplementary budget, but this year it was allocated a mere ₹2.66 crore.
Despite this, the government failed to disburse the Maiyan Samman payments to over 5.5 million women in the state on the promised date of the 11th of the month. To ease the financial strain, District Collectors (DCs) were also directed to verify the eligibility of beneficiaries who had already received payments before the elections. If any discrepancies were found, their names were to be removed from the list. To shift the blame for this delay, the government orchestrated a question through Pappu Yadav in Parliament regarding the pending dues. Hemant Soren hoped that any mention of pending dues from the Centre would bolster his political narrative. However, this move backfired as it was posed to the wrong authority.
The Union Minister of State for Finance categorically stated that none of the four heads under which funds are transferred from the Centre to state governments had any pending dues. The minister even presented data on the funds transferred to the Jharkhand government over the past three years. During the financial year 2023-24, the Centre transferred ₹56,065 crore to Jharkhand.
With this statement from the Centre, JMM’s political strategy crumbled. In response, JMM spokesperson Supriyo Bhattacharya held a press conference and threatened that if the dues were not received within 15 days, not a single piece of coal would be allowed to leave Jharkhand. However, this statement reveals a lack of political prudence and two major flaws.
First, since the Supreme Court’s decision applies to all minerals and all mining companies, JMM should have clarified whether it intended to take the same action against private companies like Tata Steel, Hindalco, and Jindal, which operate mines in the state. Simply targeting Coal India Ltd. (CIL) appears to be an attempt to corner the central government. Second, since the Supreme Court clearly stated that the payments are to be made in 12 installments from April 1, 2026, threatening mining companies to recover dues before this date raises questions of contempt of court.
According to estimates, the Supreme Court’s decision could require mining companies to pay around ₹1.5 lakh crore to state governments, collectively. If Jharkhand’s share is assumed to be 40%, the state's portion would amount to Rs 60,000 crore — far from the Rs 1.36 lakh crore being claimed. If only Coal India’s dues are considered, the amount becomes even smaller. When split into 12 annual installments, Jharkhand would receive only a few thousand crores annually. Hemant Soren is well aware of this reality but seems determined to shift the blame for his inability to fulfill election promises. His easiest option was to target the central government, but by asking an incorrect question through Pappu Yadav to the wrong authority, he exposed his misstep.
Since independence, Jharkhand has borne the brunt of discriminatory policies, despite its rich mineral resources. A major reason for its economic underdevelopment was the Freight Equalization Policy implemented in 1953, which remained in effect until 1993. This policy aimed to equalize mineral prices across the country by subsidizing transportation costs, thereby nullifying Jharkhand's natural advantage of proximity to mineral deposits. As a result, factories were established near ports in Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and coastal Maharashtra, instead of in Jharkhand and nearby mineral-rich states.
The Supreme Court’s verdict on mining offers an opportunity to correct this historical injustice. It is hoped that the Jharkhand government will rise above political manoeuvring, engage in constructive dialogue with mining companies, and ensure a technical assessment of dues. The focus should be on creating a clear schedule for receiving payments. The additional funds should be used to fund long-term development of the state through prudent capital expenditures.
